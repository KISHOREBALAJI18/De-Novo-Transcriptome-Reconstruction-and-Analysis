Its use in breast cancer treatment is mentioned, but details are limited.\\n* **Pharmacological dose of vitamin C (high-dose VC):** Shows promise in killing triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells by promoting apoptosis, inhibiting metastasis, and enhancing tumor suppressor activity.\\n* **Adjuvant therapy with CDK4/6 inhibitors (e.g., abemaciclib):** Improves the chance of cure for early breast cancer patients.\\n* **Adjuvant trastuzumab:** Standard of care for HER2-positive breast cancer, with evidence suggesting shorter durations may be effective in resource-limited settings.\\n* **Surgery (mastectomy):** A common treatment option, but can have psychological impacts on elderly women.\\n* **Vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (VABB):** A minimally invasive procedure for diagnosing breast abnormalities, particularly useful for microcalcification detection.\\n* **Platinum-based chemotherapy (with CDK4/6 inhibitor):** Used in advanced bladder cancer, but a targeted delivery method using a biotin receptor-targeting lipid PtIV prodrug amphiphile encapsulating a CDK4/6 inhibitor is explored for improved efficacy and reduced toxicity.\\n\\n\\nThanks for asking!'"

            "After hospitalization caused by COVID-19, a high prevalence of physical deterioration has been observed, hence the importance of having tests to evaluate the functional status of patients and to be able to perform a partition and subsequent referral to the physiotherapy service. This cross-sectional observational study describes the physical status according to the short physical performance battery (SPPB) of patients admitted to the hospital setting for COVID-19 and to identify variables potentially related to this outcome. Thirty-six patients admitted to the hospital setting for COVID-19 in the first wave living in the community. Patients were evaluated with the SPPB, strength test, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, the 1-minute sit-to stand, spirometry, the Barthel index, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and other patient-related data were collected. We performed bivariate and regression analyses. A linear regression was fitted, having SPPB as a dependent variable to ascertain the impact of intensive care unit (ICU) admission on physical performance. Five variables were related to SPPB. There was a significant relationship between admission to the ICU and having a heart disease (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.015), the level of physical activity (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.049), number of years smoking (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.029) and days of hospitalization (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.005). A total of 22.22% of analyzed patients suffered frailty. SPPB is related to altered respiratory pattern, quadriceps strength, 1-minute sit-to-stand and FEV1, Barthel score, days of hospitalization and FEV/FVC ratio. Lack of association between ICU stay, age or sex with SPPB results differs from the results of other studies.\n",

            "Vaccination against human papilloma virus (HPV) play a major role in preventing infection with HPV among heterosexual couples. The aim of this study was to assess public knowledge and attitude towards HPV vaccine in Saudi Arabia. This is an online cross-sectional survey study that was conducted between May and June 2023. This study utilized the convenience sampling technique to recruit the study participants. The study participants were invited to participate in this study through social media platforms (X, Facebook, and WhatsApp). Multiple logistic regression was performed to assess the factors associated with better knowledge level and the findings were presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and corresponding p-values. A total of 819 participants were included in the analysis. A total of 355 participants (43.3%) had a good knowledge score and 464 participants (56.7%) had poor knowledge. The total mean of knowledge score was (3.22&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;2.44). As the table shown, single participants reported a significant higher knowledge score mean (3.59&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;2.52) compared to married (2.84&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;2.32) (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.0001). Participants aged between 18 to 29 years reported a significant higher knowledge score mean (3.57&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;2.52) compared to participants aged between 40 and 49 years (2.60&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;2.21) (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.0001). Participants who lived in Eastern area had significantly higher odds of knowledge compared to other areas (OR&#x2005;=&#x2005;2.19, 95% CI&#x2005;=&#x2005;1.45&#x2005;-&#x2005;3.33, P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.001). Participants who worked in medical field had significantly higher odds of having good knowledge compared to other jobs (OR&#x2005;=&#x2005;3.65, 95% CI&#x2005;=&#x2005;2.39-5.57, P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.0001). Participants who had 2 sexual partners have you had in the past 2 years had a significant higher odd of having good knowledge (OR&#x2005;=&#x2005;2.05, 95% CI&#x2005;=&#x2005;1.02-4.12, P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.04). This study identified that a considerable proportion of the study participants demonstrated poor level of knowledge of HPV vaccine. Participants who lived in Eastern area, those who worked in medical field, and those who had 2 sexual partners have you had in the past 2 years had a significant higher odd of having good knowledge. Future studies should be directed towards developing educational campaign to improve public awareness of HPV.\n",

            "Pre-exam anxiety is a condition that affects students before their exams, and significantly affects their academic performance, physical, and mental state. Medical and paramedical students are more likely to experience exam-related stress and anxiety. Here we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of exam anxiety and its associated risk factors among undergraduate Arab medical and paramedical students. We performed a multi-center cross-sectional study in 6 Arab countries: Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Palestine, Algeria, and Libya from March to April 2021. We used Epi Info version 7.2 software to calculate the sample size. An online questionnaire including The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21) was used to measure exam-related anxiety. A total of 18,979 participants filled out the questionnaire, 71.3% of them were females. The majority of the study participants were between the ages of 20 to 21 years 42.4% (n&#x2005;=&#x2005;8055). On the DASS, 38.8% of participants experienced severe symptoms of depression, 47.6% of them experienced severe symptoms of anxiety, and 30.2% experienced severe symptoms of stress. Of the 3 subscales of the DASS, Females had a significantly higher risk than males of developing Depression, Anxiety, and Stress (B&#x2005;=&#x2005;2.454, P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.001), (B&#x2005;=&#x2005;4.256, P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.001), (B&#x2005;=&#x2005;3.516, P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.001) respectively. Participants aged 22 years or more were less susceptible to test-related depression (B&#x2005;=&#x2005;-0.907, P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.001) and anxiety (B&#x2005;=&#x2005;-0.958, P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.001). Students who spend 13 to 18 hours a week studying, were considerably more likely to have lower scores on all DASS subscales than those who study more than 18 hours per week, depression (B&#x2005;=&#x2005;-0.983, P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.001), Anxiety (B&#x2005;=&#x2005;-1.334, P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.001) and stress (B&#x2005;=&#x2005;-1.693, P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.001). The prevalence of exam-related anxiety, stress, and depression is high among medical and paramedical students in the Arab region. Medical educators should be aware of the impacts of this comorbidity and should work on implementing new and effective strategies to help students cope with psychological changes during exams. This paper gives a clearer insight into the level of exam anxiety and its predictors, which will enable the responsible authorities to intervene, based on the findings.\n",

            "Proteins of pathogens such as cardioviruses, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus, varicella zoster virus and bacteria of the genus Yersinia were previously shown to use a common \"DDVF\" (D/E-D/E-V-F) short linear motif (SLiM) to hijack cellular kinases of the RSK (p90 ribosomal S6 kinases) family. Notably, the leader (L) protein of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), a cardiovirus, and protein YopM of Yersinia species were shown to act as adapters to retarget RSKs toward unconventional substrates, nucleoporins and pyrin, respectively. Remarkable conservation of the SLiM docking site targeted by pathogens' proteins in RSK sequences suggested a physiological role for this site. Using SLiM prediction tools and AlphaFold docking, we screened the human proteome for proteins that would interact with RSKs through a DDVF-like SLiM. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that two candidates previously known as RSK partners, FGFR1 and SPRED2, as well as two candidates identified as novel RSK partners, GAB3 and CNKSR2 do interact with RSKs through a similar interface as the one used by pathogens, as was recently documented for SPRED2. FGFR1 employs a DSVF motif to bind RSKs and phosphorylation of the serine in this motif slightly increased RSK binding. FGFR1, SPRED2, GAB3 and CNKSR2 act upstream of RSK in the RAS-ERK MAP kinase pathway. Analysis of ERK activation in cells expressing a mutated form of RSK lacking the DDVF-docking site suggests that RSK might interact with the DDVF-like SLiM of several partners to provide a negative feed-back to the ERK MAPK pathway. Moreover, after TMEV infection, ERK phosphorylation was altered by the L protein in a DDVF-dependent manner. Taken together, our data suggest that, in addition to retargeting RSKs toward unconventional substrates, pathogen proteins carrying a DDVF-like motif can compete with endogenous DDVF-containing proteins for RSK binding, thereby altering the regulation of the RAS-ERK MAP kinase pathway.\n",

            "PM2.5 exposure is closely linked to the exacerbation of asthma. Estrogen related receptor gamma (Esrrg), an orphan nuclear receptor, exerts a crucial role as a transcription factor in various metabolic diseases. Nevertheless, the impacts of Esrrg on PM2.5-triggered asthma aggravation have not been investigated. Herein, ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthmatic mice were exposed to PM2.5 to establish a mouse model of asthma aggravation by PM2.5. In view of mRNA sequencing, <i>Esrrg</i> was the only member of nuclear receptor superfamily in the up-regulated differentially expressed genes in OVA compared with Naive groups as well as OVA+PM2.5 compared with OVA groups (|log<sub>2</sub> (fold change)|&gt;1 and p&lt;0.05). <i>In vivo</i>, adeno-associated virus carrying <i>Esrrg</i> shRNA (AAV-shEsrrg) was applied to silencing Esrrg. In addition, Esrrg activity was suppressed pharmacologically with an inverse agonist GSK5182. Either AAV-shEsrrg or GSK5182 ameliorated airway inflammation in the PM2.5-aggravated asthmatic mice. <i>In vitro</i>, isolated mouse primary tracheobronchial epithelial cells (MTEC) from mice were identified by detecting cytokeratin 7-positive cells. The treatment of adenovirus vector with shEsrrg or GSK5182 mitigated the cell damage induced by PM2.5. Notably, phosphodiesterase 3B (Pde3b) expression was declined by Esrrg inhibition <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Dual luciferase reporter and ChIP-PCR assays showed the binding of Esrrg to the Pde3b promoter. Taken together, these results revealed that Esrrg inhibition alleviated airway inflammation in the PM2.5-deteriorated asthmatic mouse model and prevented PM2.5-driven MTEC injury through binding to the <i>Pde3b</i> promoter, which might contribute to further study the therapy of PM2.5-aggravated asthma.\n",

            "Infection with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox and shingles, both manifesting as a blistering skin rash. The skin is central to VZV, as the site of viral replication, transmission from cell-free virus in blisters and as the gateway to sensory nerves for establishing latency. The existing chickenpox vaccine is based on the live attenuated vOka strain and is impaired for replication in skin. While the genetics of the vOka vaccine have been extensively studied, critical gaps exist in understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of vOka attenuation, particularly in human skin models. This review aims to explore the molecular biology of vOka vaccine, focusing on its genetic diversity, interaction with host skin pathways, and the impact of vOka mutations in key VZV genes on attenuation mechanisms in human skin models. Insights from this review may guide the development of next-generation varicella vaccines and enhance the understanding of VZV pathogenesis.\n",

            "Most previously authorized clinical antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have lost neutralizing activity to recent variants due to rapid viral evolution. To mitigate such escape, we preemptively enhance AZD3152, an antibody authorized for prophylaxis in immunocompromised individuals. Using deep mutational scanning (DMS) on the SARS-CoV-2 antigen, we identify AZD3152 vulnerabilities at antigen positions F456 and D420. Through two iterations of computational antibody design that integrates structure-based modeling, machine-learning, and experimental validation, we co-optimize AZD3152 against 24 contemporary and previous SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as 20 potential future escape variants. Our top candidate, 3152-1142, restores full potency (100-fold improvement) against the more recently emerged XBB.1.5+F456L variant that escaped AZD3152, maintains potency against previous variants of concern, and shows no additional vulnerability as assessed by DMS. This preemptive mitigation demonstrates a generalizable approach for optimizing existing antibodies against potential future viral escape.\n",

            "The two influenza B virus (FLUBV) lineages have continuously diverged from each other since the 1980s, with recent (post-2015) viruses exhibiting accelerated evolutionary rates. Emerging data from human studies and epidemiological models suggest that increased divergence in contemporary viruses may drive differential cross-protection, where infection with Yamagata lineage viruses provides limited immunity against Victoria lineage viruses. Here, we developed animal models to investigate the mechanisms behind asymmetric cross-protection between contemporary FLUBV lineages. Our results show that contemporary Victoria immunity provides robust cross-protection against the Yamagata lineage, whereas Yamagata immunity offers limited protection against the Victoria lineage. This differential cross-protection is driven by Victoria-elicited neuraminidase (NA)-specific antibodies, which show cross-lineage reactivity, unlike those from Yamagata infections.

            "Dengue, caused by the dengue virus (DENV), presents a significant public health challenge with limited effective treatments. NITD-688 is a potent panserotype DENV inhibitor currently in Phase II clinical trials. However, its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Here, we present the molecular details of how NITD-688 inhibits DENV. NITD-688 binds directly to the nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B) with nanomolar affinities across all four DENV serotypes and specifically disrupts the interaction between NS4B and nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) without significantly changing the interactions between NS4B and other viral or host proteins. NS4B mutations that confer resistance to NITD-688 reduce both NITD-688 binding to NS4B and disruption of the NS4B/NS3 interaction. Specifically, NITD-688 blocks the interaction of NS3 with a cytosolic loop within NS4B. This inhibits the formation of new NS4B/NS3 complexes and disrupts preexisting complexes in vitro and DENV-infected cells, ultimately inhibiting viral replication. Consistent with this mechanism, NITD-688 retains greater potency in cellular assays with delayed treatment compared to JNJ-1802, another NS4B inhibitor that has been studied in Phase II clinical trials. Together, these findings provide critical insights into the mechanism of action of NITD-688, facilitating the development of novel flavivirus NS4B inhibitors and informing future clinical interventions against DENV.\n",

            "Bilirubin metabolism crucially maintains normal liver function, but whether it contributes to antiviral immunity remains unknown. Here, we reveal that the liver bilirubin metabolic pathway facilitates antiviral innate immunity of the body. We discovered that viral infection upregulates uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) expression in the liver, which in turn stabilizes IRF3 proteins to promote type I interferon (IFN-I) production. Moreover, we found that serum unconjugated bilirubin (UCB), a unique physiological substrate of UGT1A1, can competitively inhibit the binding of IFN-I to IFN-I receptor 2 (IFNAR2), thus attenuating IFN-I-induced antiviral signaling of the body. Accordingly, effective bilirubin metabolism in the liver promotes antiviral immunity of the body by specifically employing liver UGT1A1-mediated enhancement of IFN-I production and reducing serum bilirubin-mediated inhibition of IFN-I signaling. This study uncovers the significance of bilirubin metabolism in antiviral innate immunity and demonstrates that conventional IFN-I therapy is less efficient for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) with high levels of bilirubin.\n",

            "Recently, episodes of exanthema subitum (ES) have been occurring later than expected in Japanese patients, though the effects of this delayed timing remain unclear. Therefore, this study examined the association between ES timing and febrile seizure (FS) in Japanese children. Information on the diagnoses of ES and FS was obtained from the Japan Environment and Children's Study, a nationwide prospective birth cohort study including 97,410 mothers and their children. Two groups were created: early ES (first ES episode between birth and 11 months of age) and late ES (first ES episode between 12 and 23 months of age) groups. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to compare the cumulative incidence rate of FS between the groups. Moreover, because a single episode of fever implies that the ES and FS occurred simultaneously, we examined the association between the ES timing and the simultaneous co-occurrence of FS with ES in a limited cohort with one fever episode until the age of 24 months. In total, 27,238 full-term children were included, with 12,565 (46.1%) in the early ES group and 14,673 (53.9%) in the late ES group. Late ES was estimated to increase the cumulative incidence risk of FS until the age of 24 months (adjusted odds ratio 1.46; 95% confidence interval [1.32-1.61]) and 48 months (1.26 [1.15-1.37]). The limited cohort included 1,022 children, and late ES was estimated to increase the risk of FS with ES (4.39 [1.48-13.02]). Late ES is estimated to increase the risk of FS. Further basic research and cohort studies, including virological examinations, are required to elucidate the pathogenesis of ES with FS.\n",

            "During the COVID-19 pandemic, effective crisis communication has been crucial yet challenging, especially for culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities. This study explored how CALD Asian communities in New Zealand accessed and trusted various sources of COVID-19 information. A cross-sectional online survey with 1,267 Asian respondents was conducted in 2021. Findings revealed that participants engaged with diverse sources for COVID-19 information, despite delays in government efforts to provide linguistically appropriate information. Those without English as a first language tended to have access to fewer information sources. Ethnic group preferences varied: Indian and South East Asian groups favoured official channels (mainstream media and government websites), the Chinese group preferred messaging applications and workplaces, and the Korean group showed a preference for ethnic community media. Trust was higher in formal information sources than online platforms and personal networks. Increased trust was noted in social media among non-English speakers and messaging applications among Koreans, while decreased trust was seen in messaging applications among Chinese and workplace information among Koreans. This research underscores the necessity of multifaceted, linguistically, and culturally appropriate crisis communication strategies. It advocates for proactive measures to establish networks for distributing vital information to CALD communities during future crisis communication.\n",

            "Ebola virus (EBOV) is a filovirus that causes severe hemorrhagic fever and has a fatality rate between 50 and 90%. The vaccines were developed against the Ebola Zaire species; therefore, it is necessary to develop vaccines against other species to control future outbreaks. The objective of this work was to obtain vaccine candidate peptides against different EBOV species through the use of bioinformatics programs and servers that allow glycoprotein (GP) to be analyzed. GP sequences of various EBOV species that did not present gaps or unspecified amino acids or that were repeated (same year, region and laboratory) were downloaded from the NCBI database. A consensus sequence was generated and used to determine vaccine candidate peptides, which were evaluated, through a combination of servers and molecular dynamics, for their ability to interact with B and T lymphocytes, toxicity, allergenicity, solvent exposure, glycosylation, antigenicity, and presence in mature GP. Five vaccine candidate peptides were identified, of which PEP4 had the best characteristics evaluated in this study. PEP4 may be a potential candidate for the development of an EBOV vaccine.\n",

            "Identification and characterization of antibody epitope targets on the hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope proteins remain crucial for developing an effective vaccine. Building on prior research defining E1/E2 antibody epitope clustering, we screened a phage display library derived from a chronic HCV patient against detergent-extracted full-length E1/E2 from both the patient's acute-phase isolate (H77, genotype 1a) and a heterologous isolate (S52, genotype 3a). This approach yielded a panel of VH1-69 derived antibody fragments (Fabs) with similar characteristics. Interestingly, all members of the panel exhibited blocking activity against both antigenic region 2 and 3 (AR2 and AR3) in competition ELISAs, which contrasts with the behavior of most previously identified AR3-targeting antibodies. The VH1-69 derived binders had a high affinity for soluble E2 in both Fab and IgG formats, with dissociation constants in the low picomolar range. These Fab binders were broadly neutralizing against a panel of HCV cell culture viruses of genotype 1-6 with higher potency than the well-characterized reference Fab, AR3A. However, in the IgG format the antibodies had similar potency. These findings expand our understanding of potential targets for vaccine development by characterizing a panel of antibodies targeting an AR3 epitope also involving or occluding the back layer of E2. The broad neutralization and high affinity of these antibodies suggest a benefit to targeting both the back layer and the front layer of E2 in HCV vaccine designs to expand the repertoire of broadly neutralizing antibodies, thereby offering promise for the development of more effective preventive measures against this pervasive human pathogen.\n",

Black male caregivers are underutilized in family-based HIV/STI prevention programming and offer a novel opportunity to protect Black girls. This study will evaluate the efficacy and implementation of an HIV/STI prevention program delivered to Black girls and male caregivers in community settings. IMAGE: IMARA for the Male Caregivers and Girls Empowerment was adapted from IMARA, an evidence-based mother-daughter intervention to decrease HIV/STI infection and increase communication and healthy relationships among girls and their male caregivers. Using an efficacy implementation design, we will test the effectiveness of IMAGE compared to a time-matched general health promotion program across six community-based organizations. Aim one will evaluate IMAGE in a 2-arm randomized controlled trial with 300 14-18-year-old Black girls and their male caregiver dyads in Chicago, IL. We hypothesize that girls who receive IMAGE will have lower STI incidence (primary outcome), fewer sexual partners, and more consistent condom use (secondary outcomes) at 6- and 12-months compared to girls in the health promotion program. Guided by the 3-Step Implementation Model, our second aim is to identify and describe factors (barriers, facilitators) and processes affecting implementation in community settings. HIV and STI disparities go beyond individual-level factors, and male caregivers may protect girls by being a sexual health resource. This study will facilitate rapid CBO uptake and ownership of IMAGE if effective. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06266416.\n",

            "The life-threatening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects about 1 in 1,000 healthy people under 50 without underlying conditions. Among patients with&#xa0;critical COVID-19 pneumonia, rare germline variants at genes controlling type I IFN immunity have been reported in up to 5% of patients. Causal etiologies in 80-85% of cases are still unknown. We analyzed two families with hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia for known single-gene inborn errors of immunity. In Family 1, two siblings with critical COVID-19 were homozygous for a DOCK2 variant, c.3624+5G&gt;A. DOCK2 deficiency is a known T-cell disorder underlying severe viral diseases. The variant resulted in skipping exon 35, which was predicted to produce a frameshift truncated protein (p.L1157Ifs*12). The proband showed markedly decreased blood CD4 T-helper cell counts, impaired T lymphocyte transformation test, and increased serum IgG, IgA, and IgE levels, as documented in other DOCK2-deficient patients. In Family 2, the proband had lethal COVID-19 and HPV-2-associated multiple recalcitrant warts. She was heterozygous for a deletion in GATA2:c.1075_1102del28, p.W360Sfs*18. GATA2 haploinsufficiency is a known cause of severe viral diseases due to a lack of plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) development. The proband had monocytopenia and a lack of circulating pDCs, as reported in other patients with GATA2 haploinsufficiency. Overall, both DOCK2 deficiency and GATA2 haploinsufficiency are associated with&#xa0;critical and often fatal COVID-19 pneumonia.\n",

            "In this study, systemic and localized immunity induced by SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern or interest (VOC/VOI) was investigated. For that, serum and tracheal aspirate soluble chemokines, pro-inflammatory/regulatory cytokines, and growth factors were measured in severe COVID-19 patients under mechanical ventilation upon infection with different SARS-CoV-2 variants, namely Alpha, Gamma, Zeta, Delta and Omicron. Increased levels of soluble mediators were observed in serum from severe COVID-19 patients regardless of the variant. In tracheal aspirate samples, the patients infected with the Gamma, Zeta, Delta, and Omicron variants exhibited reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines when compared to those infected with the Alpha variant. The trend of lower cytokine levels was also observed in the serum of patients across these variants, except for the Delta variant. By using network analysis and cytokine storm signatures, the data confirmed that severe COVID-19 induced by different variants have a completely divergent pattern of connectivity in serum samples as well as tracheal aspirates. Patients infected with variants at later time points in the pandemic such as Omicron exhibited networks of weak central architecture in serum samples as compared to tracheal aspirates, with lower number of neighborhood connections and clusters of pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines. By and large, this study points out to important systemic and local divergences and to loss of airway localized immunity in severe COVID-19 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants, which brings insight into understanding host responses and viral escape vis-&#xe0;-vis the virus mutations and evolution.\n",

            "Introduction There is increasing concern about the wellbeing of tertiary students, and this is likely to be further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is minimal information about what support is being provided. In New Zealand, there is even less information available on Pacific students in the tertiary environment. Aim This study explored the role of one tertiary institution in the provision of support for Pacific tertiary students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Pacific students' perceptions of all the support they received from the University of Otago during the COVID-19 pandemic were obtained from a cross-sectional survey between April to June 2022. All Pacific students attending the University in 2022 were eligible to participate. An online survey was emailed to all students. Results There were 1277 Pacific students enrolled at the University in 2022. Of all eligible Pacific students, 358 (28%) completed the survey. Three quarters of students had to isolate since the start of the academic year, either because they had COVID-19, or they were a close contact of someone with the disease. Of all participants, 356 (99%) received a health pack. At least two-thirds (67.6%) had accessed other support from the University. A third (32.4%) accessed support through the Otago University Students' Association and some from the community and local Pacific health provider. The support was highly valued by students who utilised these services. Discussion Institutions can provide effective leadership in the coordination of support for their students through working together with student-led, government and non-governmental organisations in the community.\n",

            "Introduction Client-Led Integrated Care (CLIC) was implemented in general practices between 2018 and 2022 in the Southern region of New Zealand. It was envisaged to be an equitable, holistic and patient-centred inter-disciplinary framework of care for those with multiple long-term conditions; usually called multimorbidity. Aim This process evaluation aimed to determine whether CLIC supported self-management ability and assessed its alignment with current priorities for multimorbidity management. Method Mixed methods were used across four purposively selected general practices. At each practice interviews were undertaken together with participant observation over 3years. This was followed by analysis of annual self-report surveys. Results CLIC worked well for those patients who were engaged, but the implementation provided minimal consideration of the resources required for everyone to receive culturally competent integrated care. Staff reported structural difficulties and wondered if the right patients were targeted. Discussion CLIC did not address the needs of all participants, nor did it target those with the most ability to benefit. In all practices, despite increasing rates of multimorbidity and social complexity during a pandemic, the organisation of general practice and how it connected with the health system remained unchanged. Transitioning to a general practice system for complex multimorbidity will require changes in funding, strong leadership and clear communication. It requires all areas of the health system to provide an integrated health and social care system that is culturally competent and engages those most vulnerable in our community.\n",

            "External resources, defined as commercial learning resources typically found online and not created by academic institutions, are increasingly utilized by students in medical education. As the use of external resources continues to grow, there is a need to understand their appropriate place within medical education and for faculty members to continue to integrate such resources into the existing medical curricula. A gap in the literature exists regarding the role of such resources within formal medical education. This narrative review identifies factors contributing to the use of external resources, integrates student and faculty perspectives to highlight their unique insights, and collaboratively proposes recommendations for the future use of external resources in medical education. Identified factors contributing to the increased use of external resources include generational affinity for technology and online learning, perceived efficiency compared to live lectures, pass-fail grading system of biomedical science courses, the pressure of board exams, and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although external resources are expensive, medical students use them to support their pre-clerkship learning and performance on national licensure exams. Faculty share the goal of student success and see potential for integration of external resources in the curriculum but raise concerns about reduced learner presence and willingness to read as well as the possibility of a universal medical curriculum. Collaborative student-faculty recommendations include the primacy of student autonomy, the benefits of classroom engagement, and the importance of cost management around third-party resources. Although external resources should not supplant all faculty instruction, they can benefit both medical students and faculty when thoughtfully and strategically integrated within the pre-clerkship curriculum to enhance learning outcomes and board exam performance.\n",

            "An estimated 10-20 million people worldwide are infected with the deltaretrovirus human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Although most infected individuals remain asymptomatic, some progress to develop the fatal and debilitating disease adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) or HTLV-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) or develop a plethora of other inflammatory disorders. In addition, HTLV-1 infection is associated with immunosuppression and a shorter lifespan. Although a protective role for neutralizing antibodies has been suggested, the role of non-neutralizing antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) remains unclear, largely because an assay to measure this response has not been established. Here, we developed a high-throughput flow cytometry-based assay system to measure HTLV-1 envelope-specific ADCC. We used a natural killer cell-resistant T-lymphoblastoid cell line stably expressing the green fluorescent protein GFP to construct a target cell line expressing HTLV-1 envelope protein and using monoclonal antibodies and plasma samples from HTLV-infected or uninfected individuals, validating the specificity and sensitivity of the assay. We detected high ADCC activity in samples from HTLV-1-infected humans. In the plasma of experimentally infected macaques, ADCC activity was measured and a correlation between ADCC activity and HTLV-1 envelope antibody titers was observed. Further, we observed a significant increase in ADCC titer over time; as HTLV-1 infection persists, a higher ADCC response is generated, potentially influencing disease outcome. ADCC titer in HTLV-1-infected macaques also positively correlated with FLT3LG, IL-17F, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and lymphocytes but negatively correlated with monocyte frequency and classical monocyte frequency. In conclusion, these findings detail the generation of a cell line that enabled development of an HTLV-specific ADCC assay, which can be employed in large clinical studies as well as research involving humans or non-human primates.IMPORTANCEThis approach measures human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-specific envelope antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity responses, provides a critical tool to investigate the role of envelope-specific binding antibodies in the immune control of HTLV infection and pathogenesis, and may help guide the development of both therapeutic and preventative vaccine approaches.\n",

            "While vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains crucial, neurological complications have been detected following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. The neurological complications of COVID-19 vaccination can be seen in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). In this study, we reviewed PNS complications after COVID-19 vaccination, their underlying mechanisms, diagnosis, and management. Inflammatory polyneuropathy, small fiber neuropathy, Parsonage-Turner syndrome (PTS), cranial mononeuropathies, and myasthenia gravis (MG) have been reported following COVID-19 vaccination. Inflammatory polyneuropathy following COVID-19 vaccination should be diagnosed early based on clinical presentation and treated with supportive care, and immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis to prevent respiratory distress if required. It is important to differentiate peripheral from central facial paralysis after COVID-19 vaccination to rule out upper motor neuron damage, including stroke. Diagnosis of small fiber neuropathy in the setting of COVID-19 vaccination should be suspected in patients with dysesthesia, dysautonomia, and lower extremity paresthesia. A skin biopsy of the proximal or distal lower limb should generally be considered for diagnosing small fiber neuropathy following COVID-19 vaccination. Even though pain at the injection site is one of the most common symptoms after COVID-19 vaccination, shoulder pain lasting more than 3 weeks should raise the suspicion of severe complications such as PTS. In addition to a proper physical examination as a reliable diagnosis tool, needle electromyography can be considered to help the diagnosis of PTS following COVID-19 vaccination. In our opinion, despite complications after COVID-19 vaccination, the benefit of vaccination immunity should not be forgotten.\n",

The liver is the second most commonly affected organ in SARS-CoV-2 infection after the lungs. Mechanisms of liver injury in COVID-19 patients can include: direct viral cytopathic effect, worsening of underlying liver disease, cytokine storm, hypoxic ischemic injury, and cholangiopathy leading to persistent marked cholestasis. Here we describe 3 infants at Texas Children's Hospital with perinatal SARS-CoV-2 exposure with persistent cholestasis and histologic evidence of extrahepatic biliary obstruction suggesting underlying biliary atresia (BA) with some atypical features possibly exacerbated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. All 3 patients described in this case series developed liver failure in the setting of low GGT cholestasis, and all 3 required liver transplantation within the first year of life. Though post-COVID cholangiopathy is described in adults in the literature, none of the infants in our series had moderate or severe COVID infection but still progressed to advanced liver disease. Instead it is very likely that the patients in our series had underlying BA with some atypical features, with the commonality of having been exposed perinatally to SARS-CoV-2 Though further studies are needed to determine causality, our case series raises the question of if the timing of exposure/infection plays a role in prognosis.\n",

Since the report of the first human case of mpox in Africa, there have been multiple outbreaks, even in nonendemic regions of the world. The emergence and re-emergence of mpox highlight the critical need for early detection, which has spurred research into applying deep learning to improve diagnostic capabilities.ObjectiveThis research aims to develop a robust hybrid long short-term memory (LSTM)-convolutional neural network (CNN) model with a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to provide a potential tool for the early detection of mpox.MethodsA hybrid LSTM-CNN multi-stream deep learning model with CBAM was developed and trained using the Mpox Skin Lesion Dataset Version 2.0 (MSLD v2.0). We employed LSTM layers for preliminary feature extraction, CNN layers for further feature extraction, and CBAM for feature conditioning. The model was evaluated with standard metrics, and gradient-weighted class activation maps (Grad-CAM) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) were used for interpretability.ResultsThe model achieved an F1-score, recall, and precision of 94%, an area under the curve of 95.04%, and an accuracy of 94%, demonstrating competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art models. This robust performance highlights the reliability of our model. LIME and Grad-CAM offered insights into the model's decision-making process.ConclusionThe hybrid LSTM-CNN multi-stream deep learning model with CBAM successfully detects mpox, providing a promising early detection tool that can be integrated into web and mobile platforms for convenient and widespread use.\n",

            "Pathogenic viruses are globally distributed and have caused severe diseases or death in wildlife populations, posing enormous threats to wild animals, especially threatened species. The transmission dynamics of pathogenic viral diseases are affected by complex factors and their interactions, such as climate, virus traits, host life-history traits, and environmental conditions. The seroprevalence of viruses can reflect the historical exposure of hosts to viruses and may indicate accumulated pathogenic viral disease severity in wildlife populations. We studied viruses with demonstrated virulence that have caused diseases or death in their natural hosts among wild terrestrial mammals. We extracted data on virus traits, host species, host life-history traits, and climate conditions from the peer-reviewed literature to explore their effects on and interactions with virus seroprevalence in wildlife populations. Ungulates were the most studied group followed by carnivores. The seroprevalence of pathogenic viruses was positively correlated with temperature in wildlife populations. The correlation between precipitation and virus seroprevalence was complicated and depended on different interactions of variables. Gregarious animals and nonmigratory ungulates were more vulnerable to high viral seroprevalence than other species. As global temperatures increase, drought will increase, and gregarious and nonmigratory ungulates may thus experience increased spread and incidence of pathogenic viruses, especially vector-borne viruses. Gregarious carnivores may face a high risk of outbreaks of viruses that are transmitted directly (e.g., canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus, and rabies virus). Our results can be used to inform protocols for surveillance of specific viruses and susceptible host life-history traits to prevent epizootics in natural populations, which will be crucial for the conservation of terrestrial mammals under global climate change.\n",

            "BackgroundThis study assessed the acceptability, among caregivers, of a mental health chatbot designed for adolescents living with HIV aged 10 to 19 years.MethodsFifteen caregivers interacted with the mental health chatbot. Pre-post assessments and semistructured interviews evaluated acceptability. Data were analyzed using a Framework Analysis approach.ResultsCaregivers aged 31 to 70 years found the chatbot acceptable on individual, interpersonal, and environmental levels. They appreciated the educational content and self-help tools, feeling the chatbot would benefit them personally. Caregivers also saw potential in the chatbot to improve communication with their children, particularly during critical periods like HIV diagnosis. Despite concerns about data costs or internet access, most viewed the chatbot as an accessible supplement to traditional mental health services.ConclusionThis study suggests that a mental health chatbot for Peruvian adolescents living with HIV was acceptable to their caregivers, potentially benefiting caregivers' mental health, enhancing caregiver-adolescent interactions, and fostering better communication.\n",

            "Cyanobacteria are intricately linked with its microbiome through multiple metabolic interactions. We assessed how these interactions might be affected by cyanophage infection and lysis in cyanobacterium Nodularia spumigena. The genome-scale metabolic models and analysis of putative metabolic interactions revealed a bidirectional cross-feeding potential within the N. spumigena microbiome, with heterotrophic bacteria exhibiting a greater level of trophic dependency on the cyanobacterium. Our results indicate that microbes associated with N. spumigena rely on the supply of various amino acids, reduced carbon compounds and protein synthesis cofactors released by the cyanobacterial host. We observed that compositional changes in the N. spumigena microbiome were associated with the multiplicity of infection and increased with increasing initial viral load. Higher mortality of N. spumigena led to decreased variability in the relative abundances of bacteria, suggesting an indirect restriction of their niche space. Lysis of N. spumigena resulted in a substantial decline in the estimated absolute abundances of heterotrophic bacteria, indicating reduced fitness of co-occurring bacteria in the absence of N. spumigena. Altogether, we demonstrate how a gradual increase in viral pressure on the photosynthetic host propagates through the co-occurring microbial community, disrupting cooperative nature and microbial connectivity within the N. spumigena microbiome.\n",

            "Cancer drug resistance has emerged as a formidable challenge in the field of clinical oncology, significantly hampering the success of treatment strategies and leading to suboptimal outcomes for patients. In a broad array of therapeutic settings, the emergence of resistance has become a primary source of concern, ranging from conventional chemotherapy to modern immunotherapy and targeted therapies. The complexity of cancer drug resistance is further exacerbated by the involvement of oncoviruses, such as human papillomavirus (HPV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV), which play pivotal roles in the initiation, progression, and response to treatment of various cancers. The intricate interactions between these oncoviruses and cancer cells have been found to significantly influence drug efficacy. These viruses can alter critical cellular pathways, including drug metabolism, DNA repair mechanisms, and the tumor microenvironment, thus promoting drug resistance. A profound understanding of these virus-cancer-drug interactions is crucial for the development of novel treatment approaches that can effectively overcome drug resistance. This review aimed to contribute to a broader awareness of the multifaceted nature of cancer drug resistance, particularly in the context of oncovirus involvement. By highlighting the critical role of oncoviruses in cancer development and treatment response, this review hopes to stimulate further research and the development of novel treatment strategies that can effectively overcome drug resistance and ultimately improve patient outcomes. As we advance toward precision oncology, a more holistic understanding of the complex interplay among cancer, its associated viruses, and therapeutic drugs is crucial for achieving optimal therapeutic responses.\n",

            "Influenza A virus (IAV) represents a considerable threat to both animal and human health, while current detection methods encounter challenges related to the spectrum, rapidity, and sensitivity of viral identification. Herein, we describe the development of a magnetic T4 phage surface plasmon resonance probe for universal, rapid, highly sensitive, and visually detectable IAV detection under dark field microscopy (DFM). Briefly, we initially fused the Soc protein of the T4 phage with a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody that exhibits broad-spectrum affinity toward the hemagglutinins of group 1 and group 2 influenza viruses, resulting in the generation of the recombinant Soc-scFv protein. Additionally, we generated another recombinant protein called AviTag-Hoc by fusing the Hoc capsid protein of T4 phage with biotin receptor peptides (AviTag). These two recombinant proteins were assembled on the head region of the T4 phage lacking both Soc and Hoc proteins. Subsequently, the resulting assembly was covalently modified with biotin using biotin-protein ligase, enabling conjugation with streptavidin-modified magnetic nanoparticles (SA@MNPs) to generate the magnetic T4 phage probe (T4@scFv@MNPs). Binding experiments demonstrated that this magnetic phage probe specifically binds to a wide range of IAVs of group 1 and group 2. Furthermore, in the presence of influenza viruses, the magnetic T4 phage probe and antibodies functionalized chip can form a sandwich complex that appears as a distinct bright golden yellow fluorescence spot visible to the naked eye under DFM. The number of viruses in samples can be automatically counted using artificial intelligence-assisted software. Assay results from both pure and real virus samples show that our magnetic phage-based DFM strategy is highly time efficient, taking approximately 30 min to complete. The method also showed excellent virus binding efficiency (&gt;85%) in both high and low concentration samples and an extremely low detection limit (1 PFU/&#x3bc;L).\n",

            "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) believed to be driven by autoimmune mechanisms. Genetic and environmental factors are implicated in MS development, and among the latter, diets and nutrients are emerging as potential critical contributors. However, a comprehensive understanding of their impacts and the underlying mechanisms involved is lacking. Harnessing state-of-the-art nutritional geometry analytical methods, it is first revealed that globally, increased carbohydrate supply is associated with increased MS disease burden, while fat supply has an opposite effect. Furthermore, in a MS mouse model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), it is found that an isocaloric diet high in carbohydrate aggravated EAE, while a diet enriched in fat (HF) is fully protective. This is reflected by reduced neuroinflammation and skewing toward anti-inflammatory phenotypes. The protective effects from the HF diet are multifaceted. Metabolically, HF increased lipid storage in immune cells, correlating with their increased anti-inflammatory IL-10 production. Transcriptionally and epigenetically, HF feeding preprogrammed na&#xef;ve T cells toward a less activated but more tolerogenic phenotype. It is showcased that manipulating diets is a potentially efficient and cost-effective approach to prevent and/or ameliorate EAE. This exhibits translational potentials for prevention/intervention of MS and possibly other autoimmune diseases.\n",

The aim of our study was to determine its diagnostic accuracy in hospitalized febrile children. <b>Methods:</b> A prospective study was performed from December 2023 to April 2024 in two pediatric clinics at \"Aghia Sophia\" Children's Hospital, Athens, Greece. Patients &gt; 3 months old, presenting with fever, clinical suspicion of acute infection, and symptoms onset up to 7 days prior were considered eligible. Patients with cancer, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Tuberculosis (TB), and immunodeficiency were excluded. Two pediatricians reviewed the clinical, laboratory, microbiological, and radiological data and assigned the final diagnosis. The experts were blinded to the BV scores. <b>Results:</b> One hundred and thirty-five patients were enrolled. The predominant medical condition was respiratory tract infection (59.3% lower, 26.7% upper). Twenty-nine (21.5%) patients were diagnosed with bacterial infections. The BV score demonstrated a sensitivity of 96.2%, specificity of 88.7%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 98.9% for bacterial infections. Equivocal BV scores were reported in 8.9% of cases and were excluded from calculations. The area under the curve was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93-0.99). A ROC curve analysis was performed, and the optimal cut-off score was estimated at 60, providing a sensitivity of 93.1%, specificity of 88.7%, and NPV of 97.9%. <b>Conclusions:</b> In our study population, the BV score showed high sensitivity and NPV in bacterial infection diagnosis. Further studies are needed to assess the possibility of replacing the \"equivocal\" range with a narrower one or a specific cut-off value.\n",

            "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Since its emergence in 2020, researchers worldwide have been collaborating to better understand the SARS-CoV-2 disease's pathophysiology. Disease severity can vary based on several factors, including comorbidities and genetic variations. Notably, recent studies have highlighted the role of genes associated with athletic performance, such as ACE, ACTN3, and PPARGC1A, in influencing muscle function, cardiovascular health, and the body's metabolic response. Given that these genes also impact oxidative metabolism, inflammation, and respiratory efficiency, we hypothesized that they might play a critical role in the host's response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study aimed to investigate the association between disease severity and genetic polymorphisms in these sport performance-related genes, specifically ACE rs4646994, ACTN3 rs1815739, and PPARGC1A rs8192678. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 422 COVID-19-positive patients were included in this study. The participants were divided into three groups: a severe group (77 patients) requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, a mild group (300 patients) exhibiting at least one symptom, and an asymptomatic control group. Genotyping was performed using restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR. <b>Results:</b> The D allele and DD genotype of ACE and the T allele and TT genotype of ACTN3 were found to confer protective effects against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conversely, the PPARGC1A TC genotype and the ACE-PPARGC1A ins/ins + TC combined genotype were associated with increased disease severity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> Although vaccination has reduced the severity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus continues to impact human health. Inter-individual differences due to these genetic variations will broaden the horizon of knowledge on the pathophysiology of the disease.\n",

            "Activated immune cells are highly susceptible to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Vitamin D (VitD) induces antimicrobial responses and reduces cellular activation. We investigated VitD effects on HIV-1 replication, glucose uptake, and gene regulation using computational and in vitro approaches. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from healthy male donors were treated with VitD and infected with HIV-1. After 72 h, p24 protein was measured to assess viral replication. VitD effects on anti- and pro-HIV genes were analyzed by a Boolean network model based on curated databases and the literature. CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptor expression, AKT phosphorylation, and glucose uptake were evaluated by flow cytometry, and expression of some model-identified genes was quantified by qPCR. VitD reduced p24 by 53.2% (<i>p</i> = 0.0078). Boolean network modeling predicted that VitD upregulates antiviral, migration, and cell-differentiation related genes, while downregulating genes related to cellular activation, proliferation, glucose metabolism, and HIV replication, notably <i>AKT1, CCNT1, SLC2A1, HIF1A,</i> and <i>PFKL</i>. In vitro, VitD reduced AKT phosphorylation by 26.6% (<i>p</i> = 0.0156), transcription of <i>CCNT1</i> by 22.7% (<i>p</i> = 0.0391), and glucose uptake by 22.8% (<i>p</i> = 0.0039) without affecting classic antiviral genes or coreceptor expression.

Advanced age and comorbidities partially explain severe cases of the disease, but genetic factors also play a significant role. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been instrumental in identifying loci associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we report the results from a &gt;820 K variant GWAS in a COVID-19 patient cohort from the hospitals associated with IIS Biobizkaia. We compared intensive care unit (ICU)-hospitalized patients with non-ICU-hospitalized patients.

            "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can effectively suppress the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but it cannot completely eradicate the virus. The persistent existence of the HIV reservoir is a major obstacle in the quest for a cure. To date, there have been a total of seven cured cases of HIV worldwide. These patients all cleared HIV while undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for hematological malignancies. However, in these cases, the specific mechanism by which allo-HSCT leads to the eradication of HIV remains unclear, so it is necessary to conduct an in-depth analysis. Due to the difficulty in obtaining donors and the risks associated with transplantation, this treatment method is not applicable to all HIV patients. There is still a need to explore new treatment strategies. In recent years, emerging therapies such as neutralizing antibody immunotherapy, chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy, gene editing, and antiviral therapies targeting the reservoir have attracted wide attention due to their ability to effectively inhibit HIV replication. This article first elaborates on the nature of the HIV reservoir, then deeply explores the treatment modalities and potential success factors of HIV cured cases, and finally discusses the current novel treatment methods, hoping to provide comprehensive and feasible strategies for achieving the cure of HIV.\n",

This work examines cutting-edge formulation and emerging techniques for safer delivery of mRNA vaccines. Inspired by the success of lipid nanoparticles (LNP) in delivering mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, a variety of other formulations have been developed to deliver mRNA vaccines for diverse infections. The meritorious features of nanoparticle-based mRNA delivery strategies, including LNP, polymeric, dendrimers, polysaccharide-based, peptide-derived, carbon and metal-based, DNA nanostructures, hybrid, and extracellular vesicles, have been examined. The impact of these delivery platforms on mRNA vaccine delivery efficacy, protection from enzymatic degradation, cellular uptake, controlled release, and immunogenicity has been discussed in detail. Even with significant developments, there are certain limitations to overcome, including toxicity concerns, limited information about immune pathways, the need to maintain a cold chain, and the necessity of optimizing administration methods. Continuous innovation is essential for improving delivery systems for mRNA vaccines.

The focus has shifted towards managing mild and moderate forms of disease through outpatient care, aiming to prevent healthcare system overload. Consequently, identifying markers that could be used in stratifying the risk and the prognostic assessment has become crucial. Cardiovascular implications of COVID-19 are a critical area of research due to their significant impact on disease severity, mortality, and morbidity. <b>Methods</b>: We conducted a retrospective, observational study and included 472 patients, diagnosed with COVID-19, all of whom were admitted to Prof. Dr. Matei Bals National Institute of Infectious Disease, Bucharest, Romania. Levels of cardiac biomarkers like creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-myocardial band (CKMB), myoglobin, troponins, and NT-pro-BNP were measured and analyzed in relation to clinical presentation and outcomes. <b>Results</b>: We combined CKMB, myoglobin, and troponin I to predict hospital length of stay (LOS). Our model significantly predicted LOS (F = 12.537, <i>p</i> = 0.0001), with higher levels associated with prolonged stays (&#x3b2; = 0.166, <i>p</i> = 0.000). Logistic regression demonstrated that the combination of elevated CKMB and myoglobin levels significantly increased the odds of a longer LOS (OR = 1.679, <i>p</i> = 0.000). Furthermore, we found significant correlations with acute respiratory failure (<i>p</i> = 0.001), severe forms of disease (<i>p</i> = 0.000), and the development of complications during hospitalization (<i>p</i> = 0.027). <b>Conclusions</b>: These findings emphasize the value of combining cardiac biomarkers to stratify risk and predict hospital outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Routine cardiac monitoring and targeted management strategies could decrease the risk of complications, reducing the LOS. Our findings highlight the potential of cardiac biomarkers as prognostic tools to stratify risk, guide clinical interventions, and improve outcomes in COVID-19 patients.\n",

Despite substantial declines in case fatalities following widespread vaccination campaigns, the threat of future coronavirus outbreaks remains a concern. Current treatments for COVID-19 have been repurposed from existing therapies for other infectious and non-infectious diseases. Emerging evidence suggests a role for genetic factors in both susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and response to treatment. However, comprehensive studies correlating clinical outcomes with genetic variants are lacking. The main aim of our study is the identification of host genetic biomarkers that predict the clinical outcome of COVID-19 pharmacological treatments. <b>Methods</b>: In this study, we present findings from GWAS and candidate gene and pathway enrichment analyses leveraging diverse patient samples from the Spanish Coalition to Unlock Research of Host Genetics on COVID-19 (SCOURGE), representing patients treated with immunomodulators (<i>n</i> = 849), corticoids (<i>n</i> = 2202), and the combined cohort of both treatments (<i>n</i> = 2487) who developed different outcomes.

Enrichment analyses revealed overrepresentation of genes involved in the innate immune system, drug ADME, viral infection, and the programmed cell death pathways associated with the response phenotypes. <b>Conclusions</b>: Our study provides an initial framework for understanding the genetic determinants of treatment response in COVID-19 patients, offering insights that could inform precision medicine approaches for future epidemics.\n",

            "This paper presents a conceptual model for understanding cross-border precarity during the COVID-19 pandemic. It examines how public health emergencies exacerbate the challenges faced by expatriates and their families in cross-border contexts. The case study illustrates the complex nature of precarity, emphasising how its various forms like systemic, institutional, economic, health, social, and psychological are interacted and intensified during the pandemic, leading to lasting instability for expatriates that extends beyond borders and impacts their families. Findings indicate that restrictive immigration policies, delayed repatriation efforts, and inadequate support mechanisms exacerbated expatriates' hardships, which in turn amplified the economic and psychological strains faced by dependents in Kerala. This paper argues for integrating expatriate needs into the International Health Regulations (IHR) for managing public health emergencies, including comprehensive guidelines for repatriation and expatriate-inclusive country capacity assessments. This model serves as a tool to inform policymakers, social work practitioners, and public health professionals in designing interventions and policies that address the unique and intersecting forms of precarity in times of crisis, ultimately contributing to a more inclusive, transnational approach to public health resilience.\n",

            "Monitoring the effectiveness of antiretroviral treatment by measuring viral load is a strong recommendation from the WHO following the intensification of this therapy, which, if well managed, improves patients' quality of life. In children, treatment options are limited and virological non-suppression is high. Virological suppression among children living with HIV who were followed at care facilities during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is poorly documented in countries with intermediate resources, such as Benin. Methods A longitudinal study was carried out from November 20, 2020, among children under 15 years of age who had been receiving ART for at least six months in five healthcare facilities. TCD4 lymphocytes (LTCD4) count was performed using the CyFlow counter II (from Partec laboratories). Viral load was performed using the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay (Abbott Molecular, Inc.). The linear range of 40-10.000.000 copies/ml and a detection limit of 40 copies/ml were defined by the manufacturers. Virological success was assessed as a suppressed viral load (VL&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;3log<sub>10</sub>). For children whose VL<sub>1</sub>&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;3log<sub>10</sub>, WHO 2016 recommendations were applied and therapeutic education sessions were offered for 3 months, after which VL<sub>2</sub> was measured. Children whose (VL<sub>1</sub> and VL<sub>2</sub>)&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;3log<sub>10</sub> were considered not suppressed. Results The mean age of 305 children enrolled was 110 (SD 41.25) months, with a predominance of girls at 52.8% (161/305). The median LTCD4 at study starting was 814 [IQR 544-1118] cells/&#xb5;l. Overall, 73.11% (223/305) of children achieved virological success at the first viral load measurement, compared to 79.63% (219/275) at the second (03 months after the first). Between the two measurements, 9.83% (30/305) of children did not keep their medical appointments due to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic restrictions. Also, 20.73% (17/82) of non-suppressed children at VL<sub>1</sub> went undetectable. Among the 17.1% (47/275) of unsuppressed children, 10.64% (5/47) were on integrase strand transfer inhibitors as DTG (Dolutegravir). Conclusion This study, conducted in children on ART during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, highlighted a high rate of retention in care and viral suppression. However, there are challenges in achieving the UNAIDS third 95 to ensure sustainable viral suppression in children.\n",

To expand our knowledge of avian influenza viruses across New Zealand, we sampled wild aquatic birds from New Zealand, its outer islands and its subantarctic territories. Metatranscriptomic analysis of 700 individuals spanning 33 species revealed no detection of H5N1 during the annual 2023-2024 migration.

            "Phage satellites are defined as viruses that have a life cycle dependent on a helper virus. Thus, they are often&#xa0;considered as parasites of parasites, although recent work suggests it may be more accurate to consider them as symbionts that evolved along a parasitism-mutualism continuum. Over the past years, multiple studies have examined the fascinating life cycle of these elements, focusing on the characterization of the molecular mechanisms they use to hijack the helper phage machinery for their own packaging and transfer. As some phage satellites encode toxins and other virulence and resistance genes, the impact of these elements on bacterial virulence has also been extensively analysed. Recent studies suggest that satellites have unprecedented roles in the ecology and evolution of bacteria and their mobile genetic elements. In this Review, we explore the genetics and the life cycle of these elements, with special emphasis on the new mechanisms involved in their spread in nature. We discuss the unexpected impact of these elements on the evolution of other mobile genetic elements and their host bacteria, and examine their potential origins.\n",

            "Advancements in our understanding of genetic disease and adeno-associated virus has prompted great excitement into the field of AAV-mediated gene therapy, particularly for genetic diseases of the central nervous system, including retinal disorders. Despite significant progress, exemplified by the approval of therapies such as Luxturna&#xae; and Zolgensma&#xae;, a substantial number of therapies remain in pre-clinical or early clinical stages, with many failing to advance to later phases. Whilst the use of animal models to test safety and delivery route efficacy of AAV treatments is imperative, differences in tissue structure and physiology between humans and animal models has restricted precise disease modelling and gene therapy development for many CNS disorders. Alongside the FDA push for non-animal alternative models, researchers are increasingly turning to human-based models, including stem cell-derived organoids, which can offer a more accurate representation of human cellular microenvironments and niches. As such, this review explores the advantages and limitations of brain and retinal organoids as pre-clinical models of disease, with a primary focus on their utility in identifying novel AAV capsids, cell-specific promoters, and their role in recent pre-clinical AAV gene therapy studies.\n",

            "The availability of influenza vaccines that can induce broadly protective immune responses is highly desirable and could also mitigate the impact of future influenza pandemics. Ideally, these vaccines also induce virus-specific CD8&#x2009;+&#x2009;T cells, which have been identified as an independent correlate of protection. In the present study, we explored the use of an artificial immunogen that comprises of twenty highly conserved influenza virus CD8&#x2009;+&#x2009;T cell epitopes with an HLA coverage of 99.5% of the world population. The highly attenuated viral vector Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) was used to deliver the artificial poly-epitope sequence (rMVA-PE) and by using T cell lines raised against individual epitopes, we confirmed that the epitopes are liberated from the artificial immunogen. For efficient antigen processing and presentation, the epitopes were separated by spacer sequences. Stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HLA-typed blood donors with rMVA-PE resulted in the activation of influenza virus-specific T cell responses. Furthermore, immunization of humanized HLA-A2.1-/HLA-DR1-transgenic H-2 class I-/class II-knockout mice (HLA-A*02:01) with rMVA-PE induced influenza virus-specific CD8&#x2009;+&#x2009;T cell responses. Thus, rMVA-PE proved to be immunogenic both in vitro and in vivo and constitutes a promising vaccine candidate for the induction of cross-reactive CD8&#x2009;+&#x2009;T cell responses that could afford protection against antigenically distinct influenza A viruses (IAV) of various subtypes and species, and is currently considered for further clinical testing.\n",

            "The 2019 pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 led to millions of deaths worldwide since its emergence. The viral genomic material can code structural and non-structural proteins including the main protease or 3CL<sup>pro</sup>, a cysteine protease that cleavages the viral polyprotein generating 11 proteins that participate in viral pre-replication. Thus, 3CL<sup>pro</sup> is a promising therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition by new drugs or drug repositioning because 3CL<sup>pro</sup> is dissimilar to human proteases. We conducted in vitro assays demonstrating the modulation activity of ambenonium, a drug already used in Myasthenia gravis that acts by inhibiting the action of acetylcholinesterase, and had its potential inhibitory activity against viral replication pointed out in a previous in silico study. In concentrations of 100&#xa0;&#xb5;M, 50&#xa0;&#xb5;M, 25&#xa0;&#xb5;M, 10&#xa0;&#xb5;M, and 1&#xa0;&#xb5;M there was no inhibition in the formation of lysis plates, with a slight increase in the genome copy number at the higher concentrations evaluated. However, in the concentrations of 0,1&#xa0;&#xb5;M and 0,01&#xa0;&#xb5;M, there was a reduction in the number of lysis plates. This behavior suggests that the ambenonium acts as a modulator of viral activity in vitro. To investigate potential conformational changes in the protein between dimeric and monomeric forms in the presence of the compound, a local docking analysis was performed. Results indicated this conformational shift is possible, though further studies are needed to confirm these findings.\n",

We showed that the vaccine could stimulate antibodies, small proteins that the body produces against the SAR-CoV-2 original and the mutant BA.4/5 variants to fight the virus. This new design produced improved antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 mutant variants compared with older designs, but PLWH with a compromised immune system have a short-lived protection against the evolving virus.\n",

The effects of SM on patients receiving chemotherapy are unknown. Our study aimed to investigate the effects of SM on oxygenation and CO2 retention in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and to examine its possible clinical consequences. Patients diagnosed with cancer and receiving chemotherapy were included in the study. Venous blood gas, SO2 by pulse oximeter, and vital signs were recorded before and after treatment. Acute toxicities encountered during treatment were recorded. One hundred twenty-six patients with a median age of 60 (33-85) were evaluated in the study. The comparison of pre-post treatment parameters showed statistically significant changes in Ph (7.37 vs. 7.35, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01), pCO2 (44.2 vs. 45.8, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.049), HCO3 (25.7 vs. 25.3, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003), SpO2 (97.0 vs. 96.0, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.08), fever (36.4 vs. 36.3, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.023). All the changes were clinically insignificant and in normal ranges. Chemotherapy-related acute toxicity was noted in 4 (3.2%) of the patients. Lung morbidity, cancer type, lung metastasis status, treatment applied, duration of therapy, and acute toxicity do not affect the current parameters. In our study, it was shown that constantly wearing a SM in patients receiving chemotherapy caused CO2 retention and a tendency to hypoxemia. However, the current changes were clinically insignificant and within the normal range. Surgical masks can be used safely in cancer patients receiving systemic treatment.\n",

            "This study investigates the relationship between Cyclin D1 (CCND1) gene and promoter methylation and liver fibrosis (LF)/liver cirrhosis (LC)induced by chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are collected from patients diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and hepatitis B-related LF/LC, as well as from healthy individuals. The mRNA levels and promoter methylation of the CCND1 gene are measured. Single-cell analysis is performed to determine the cell types primarily expressing the CCND1 gene in LF/LC. The GSE84044 dataset is utilized to validate the experimental results. Single-gene GSEA and immune infiltration analyses are conducted to identify significant pathways and immune characteristics associated with the CCND1 gene. The mRNA level of CCND1 in PBMCs from patients with hepatitis B-related LF/LC is elevated compared to those with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and healthy individuals, while the promoter methylation level of CCND1 is reduced. Single-cell analysis indicates high expression of CCND1 in M2 macrophages (M2) and T cells. The GSE84044 dataset confirms higher CCND1 mRNA levels in liver tissues from patients with CHB-related LF/LC compared to CHB patients. Single-gene GSEA analysis associates CCND1 expression with natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, T cell receptor signaling, and B cell receptor signaling pathways. Increased expression of CCND1 enhances immune infiltration during the fibrosis/cirrhosis process of CHB. The CCND1 expression and promoter methylation may be involved in the process of LF/LC in CHB and may be related to the immune response in the course of the disease.\n",

            "As many as 80% of patients receiving palliative care at Hospice Africa Uganda have cancer and/or HIV/AIDS. Given that cancer and HIV/AIDS have different trajectories since antiretroviral therapy (ART) became widely available, these two patients groups may differ in their care needs. This study's main objective was to identify, summarise and compare the reasons for referral, main distresses, and goals of care among cancer and HIV/AIDS patients in palliative care. A cross-sectional study employing a retrospective design was conducted on 100 consecutively sampled charts consisting of 50 cancer and 50 HIV/AIDS patients. Data were extracted using a researcher-developed structured checklist. Data were entered and analysed in STATA, version 17 using descriptive statistics and Chi-Square (&#x3c7;<sup>2</sup>) test. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The primary reason for referral to palliative care was pain and symptom control at 22 (44%) and 36(72%) among cancer patients and HIV/AIDS patients respectively (&#x3c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;8.046, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005). The most prevalent main distress in both groups was unrelieved pain at 23(46%) in the cancer group versus 24(48%) in the HIV/AIDS group (&#x3c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0401, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.841). The most common goal of care was pain and symptom control at 33(66%) and 29(58%) among cancer patients and HIV/AIDS patients respectively (&#x3c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.6791, P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.41). The study findings showed that pain is the most prevalent symptom and the main cause of distress in HIV/AIDs and cancer patients in palliative care. Clinicians need to prioritize pain and symptoms assessment and management in order to optimise quality of life for patients and their families.\n",

            "The accessory protein Vpx from the red-capped mangabey or mandrill SIV (SIV<sub>rcm/mnd-2</sub>) lineage has been reported to increase HIV-1 infection in resting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells without affecting SAMHD1, a known target of Vpx in HIV-1 infection. This indicates that Vpx, in addition to SAMHD1, circumvents other restriction factors for lentiviruses. To identify potential restriction factors, this study examined cellular proteins interacting with Vpx<sub>rcm</sub> and found that keratin-72 (KRT72), an intermediate filament (IF) protein expressed in resting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, is a host antiviral factor targeted by Vpx. Vpx<sub>rcm/mnd-2</sub> lineages could strongly promote KRT72 degradation, resulting in increased HIV-1 infection in resting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. We discovered that KRT72 restricts HIV-1 replication by sequestering incoming HIV-1 capsids in cytoplasmic IFs. With KRT72, the capsid cores of HIV-1 become attached to IFs, and their trafficking toward the nucleus is inhibited. In contrast, without KRT72, HIV-1 capsids are transported to the nucleus, leading to high levels of integrated HIV-1 DNA. Thus, KRT72 is a Vpx-counteracted antiviral factor that binds the incoming capsids to cytoplasmic IFs, restricting HIV-1 infection in resting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.\n",

            "With the broad spread of the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), there is an increasing demand for more effective and broadly protective vaccines. Here, we designed CHIKV mRNA vaccines containing full-length structural proteins or part of structural proteins (envelope proteins) based on conserved sequences from 769 viral strains encompassing four lineages. The vaccine induced strong cellular and humoral immune responses in BALB/c mice and provided robust protection. Immunization of BALB/c mice with either of the two vaccines induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies against pseudoviruses from four distinct lineages, highlighting their potential for broad cross-lineage protective efficacy. Immunoglobulin repertoire analysis revealed two important BCR V-J gene combinations, IgHV1-4-IgHJ3 and IgHV1-4-IgHJ2, and lineage-specific immunity analysis revealed significant upregulation of TCRs containing V19 and V20. BCR and TCR immunodiversity may be a potential reason for the broad-spectrum protection against CHIKV afforded by the vaccine. In A129 mice, it elicited lower levels of neutralizing antibodies but prevented mouse mortality and cleared chronic infection. In the rhesus macaque model, both vaccines elicited a certain level of humoral and cellular immune responses and protected the rhesus macaques from the CHIKV challenge. In conclusion, the results from both mouse and rhesus macaque models indicate that the vaccine could be a candidate for clinical use against CHIKV.\n",

This study aimed to investigate potential sex-based disparities in cardiovascular outcomes among individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 A systematic search was performed in PUBMED/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and EMBASE, up until January 2024 to identify studies measuring the sex-based differences in cardiovascular outcomes associated with COVID-19. The outcomes of interest included (myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, ischemic stroke, major bleeding, mortality, heart failure and hospitalization length). The meta-analysis was performed using the 'Stata' software, version 18. We identified 11 studies involving 31,044 males and 25,917 females in our review. A slightly lower risk of myocardial infarction in females (RR: 1.24; 95% CI [1.03, 1.49]; p = 0.02) contrasted with a substantially increased risk of venous thromboembolic events (RR: 1.43; 95% CI [1.19, 1.71]; p = 0.00) in males. Additionally, males displayed a slightly higher risk of major bleeding (RR: 1.22; 95% CI [1.06, 1.40]; p = 0.00). This trend continued with significantly higher rates of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) utilization (RR: 2.14; 95% CI [1.11, 4.13]; p&#xa0;= 0.02) in males. Moreover, stroke outcomes and overall mortality were demonstrably worse for males (RR: 1.46; p = 0.05 and RR: 1.21; p = 0.00, respectively). Males with COVID-19 face higher risks of myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, ischemic stroke, major bleeding, and mortality. Heart failure and hospitalization length show no gender disparity. These findings highlight the crucial role of gender in COVID-19's cardiovascular complications.\n",

            "The concept of macrophage polarization has been largely used in human diseases to define a typology of activation of myeloid cells reminiscent of lymphocyte functional subsets. In COVID-19, several studies have investigated myeloid compartment dysregulation and macrophage polarization as an indicator of disease prognosis and monitoring. SARS-CoV-2 induces an in vitro activation state in monocytes and macrophages that does not match the polarization categories in most studies. In COVID-19 patients, monocytes and macrophages are activated but they do not show a polarization profile. Therefore, the investigation of polarization under basic conditions was not relevant to assess monocyte and macrophage activation. The analysis of monocytes and macrophages with high-throughput methods has allowed the identification of new functional subsets in the context of COVID-19. This approach proposes an innovative stratification of myeloid cell activation. These new functional subsets of myeloid cells would be better biomarkers to assess the risk of complications in COVID-19, reserving the concept of polarization for pharmacological programme evaluation. This review reappraises the polarization of monocytes and macrophages in viral infections, particularly in COVID-19.\n",

            "Evidence regarding the host's response to peripheral pathogens in humans abound, whereas studies on the pathogenesis of central nervous system-penetrating infections are relatively scarce. However, given the spate of epidemic and pandemic neuroinfections in the 21st century, the field has experienced a renewed interest lately. This chapter discusses a timely and exciting topic on the roles of glial cells, mainly microglia and astrocytes, in neuroinvasive infections. This chapter considered fungal, viral, and bacterial neuroinfections, X-raying their neuroinvasiveness, neurotropism, and neurovirulence before focusing on specific examples notable for each category, including Escherichia coli, Cryptococcus neoformans, and SARS-CoV-2. These infections are renowned worldwide for a high case-fatality rate, leaving many survivors with life-long morbidity and others with a bleak future neurologic prognosis. Importantly, the chapter discusses possible ways microglia and astrocytes are culpable in these infections and provides approaches by which they can be manipulated for therapeutic purposes, identifying viable research gaps in the process. Additionally, it offers a synopsis of ongoing works considering microglial selective targeting to attenuate the pathology, morbidity, and mortality associated with these neuroinfections.

            "The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) significantly impacted individuals' daily lives and may provide meaningful implications for well-being. This study examined how individuals' well-being changed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and explored the potential risk and protective factors for well-being. A total of 15,574 Japanese adults aged 15 to 89&#x2009;years participated in baseline online surveys in February 2019 or February 2020 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;10,293 in the 2019 sample and n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5,281 in the 2020 sample). Both samples were followed up in 2021 and 2022. Well-being was indexed as a single-item indicator of life satisfaction. Piecewise growth models demonstrated that life satisfaction typically remained stable before and during the pandemic. Risk and protective factors for life satisfaction were consistent across samples overall. Individuals perceiving better economic satisfaction and self-rated health following the pandemic and without a support network before the pandemic showed greater increases in life satisfaction after the outbreak. Our findings suggest that most individuals' well-being did not deteriorate following the pandemic but that some individuals might have lost or even gained resources for life satisfaction. To better understand resilience and well-being, researchers should consider how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed multiple aspects of daily lives.\n",

            "Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 has not stopped evolving, leading to the emergence of variants of concern (VoCs) involved in significant immune escape. Here, we compared the immunogenicity of different prime-boost vaccination regimens against SARS-CoV-2 wildtype (WT) and its Beta, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 VoCs. We used 5 databases to retrieve publications and random-effect models to estimate pooled neutralization titers. We included 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 16 non-RCTs, 10 prime-boost vaccination regimens, and 4598 subjects. We found neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 decreased with virus evolution. The heterologous immunization was more effective. The increase in neutralization titers against SARS-CoV-2 WT and Beta, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 VoCs after heterologous immunization was 1.41(95%CI:0.82-2.01), 0.90(95%CI:0.39-1.41), 1.23 (95%CI: 0.81-1.65), and 1.32 (95%CI: 0.99-1.65), respectively. Furthermore, the booster dose of viral vector vaccine did not show a higher increase in neutralization titers against SARS-CoV-2 WT(MD=0.48; 95%CI:-1.12-1.09), Beta (MD=0.20; 95%CI:-0.26-0.67), Delta (MD=0.35; 95%CI:-0.09-0.79), and Omicron BA.1 (MD=0.38; 95%CI:-0.14-0.89) VoCs. The combination of inactivated-recombinant protein vaccines showed a higher increase in neutralization titers (Beta: MD=1.88 and Delta: MD=1.70) than other combinations of vaccines. However, only a combination of mRNA-viral vector vaccines showed a higher increase in neutralization titers (MD:1.52; 95%CI:0.34-2.70) against Omicron BA.1 VoC. Interestingly, the viral vector-mRNA immunization regimen appears better compared to mRNA-viral vector regimen, especially against Beta and Delta VoCs. Overall, the type of combination followed by the order of administration of COVID-19 vaccines could be a potential vaccine strategy against the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n",

A lack of sensitive cell lines and efficient animal models hinders research on HBoV, including the development of anti-HBoV drugs or vaccines. Although the construction of a wild-type HBoV1 infectious clone has been reported, generating HBoV1 infectious clone carrying foreign reporter genes with suitable insertion sites in its genome while retaining replicative ability remains challenging. Here, HBoV1 infectious clones harboring the 11-amino-acid HiBiT tag at five distinct insertion sites were constructed and evaluated. Only the recombinant HBoV1 carrying the HiBiT tag in the N-terminus of the NS1 protein (HBoV1-HiBiT<sub>NS1</sub>) displayed comparable characteristics to wild-type HBoV1 as determined via the analysis of viral DNA copy number, NanoLuc activity, viral protein expression, and the formation of replication intermediates. Notably, the replication kinetics of HBoV1-HiBiT<sub>NS1</sub> could be examined by monitoring NanoLuc activity, which was noted to be correlated with the viral DNA level. Additionally, we successfully applied HiBiT-tagged HBoV1 for the evaluation of antiviral drug activity and identified ivermectin (EC50 = 2.27 &#x3bc;M) as a potent anti-HBoV1 replication drug. Overall, our study demonstrated that the HBoV1-HiBiT<sub>NS1</sub> reporter can serve as a convenient platform for screening candidate drugs targeting HBoV1 replication and may also be useful for investigating the life cycle of the virus.\n",

            "The COVID-19 pandemic remains an ongoing global health threat, yet effective treatments are still lacking. This has led to a high demand for complementary/alternative medicine, such as Chinese herbal medicines for curbing the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the dual anticancer and antiviral activities of many herbal drugs, they may hold a multifaceted potential to tackle both cancer and SARS-CoV-2. Triptolide is the major bioactive compound isolated from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb recognized for its beneficial pharmacological properties in many diseases, including cancer and viral infection. However, its application in the clinic has been greatly limited due to its toxicity and poor water solubility. Here, from a screen of a natural compound library of Chinese Pharmacopoeia, we identified triptolide as a top candidate to inhibit cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrated that triptolide robustly blocked viral entry at nanomolar concentrations in cellular models, with broad range activity against emerging Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2. Mechanistically, triptolide disrupted the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with its receptor ACE2. Furthermore, we synthesized water-soluble, triptolide-derived carbon quantum dots. Compared to triptolide, these highly biocompatible nanomaterials exhibited prominent antiviral capabilities against Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 with less cytotoxicity. Finally, we showed that triptolide-derived carbonized materials excelled in their anticancer properties compared to triptolide and Minnelide, a water-soluble analog of triptolide. Together, our results provide a rationale for the potential development of triptolide-carbonized derivatives as a promising antiviral candidate for the current pandemic and future outbreaks, as well as anticancer agents.\n",

            "In severe COVID-19 patients, excessive inflammation can lead to multiorgan dysfunction. Current anti-inflammatory treatments like glucocorticoids partially improve the outcomes, while immune systems are compromised. We have identified that SARS-CoV-2-infected obese mice were a good model of the cytokine storm seen in COVID-19. Here, we revealed that iguratimod (IGU), an approved agent for rheumatoid arthritis, improved survival by attenuating inflammation with minimal immune suppression. In this study, C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a normal-fat diet (NFD) for ten weeks before being infected with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2. IGU significantly improved survival rates and reduced lung inflammation in HFD-fed mice, with minimal impact on interferon-induced genes and viral load. Meanwhile, dexamethasone (DEX) did not improve survival, while it suppressed various immune reactions with different mechanisms to IGU. Interestingly, IGU-treated mice had fewer SARS-CoV-2 positive cells in the lung, although viral replication was comparable to the control mice. Neither IGU nor DEX inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero-E6 cells, unlike the antiviral agent, remdesivir. Of note, IGU was effective prophylactically and therapeutically in HFD mice, and showed beneficial effects in NFD-fed mice with a lethal dose exposure of SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrated that IGU could be a promising treatment for severe COVID-19, especially in obese patients, by fine-tuning inflammation without compromising antiviral immunity. This study supports the possibility of drug repositioning for IGU COVID-19 beyond autoimmune diseases.\n",

In this study, we developed a ferritin-based nanoparticle vaccine for PEDV by combining gene delivery functions of recombinant adenoviruses. To generate nanoparticles, the S1 subunit of the spike protein was genetically linked to the N-terminus of the human ferritin heavy chain (hFTHC), and recombinant adenoviruses were generated to deliver the genetic material. The efficacy of S1 conjugated human ferritin heavy chain (S1-hFTHC) adenoviruses against S1 adenoviruses was evaluated in BALB/c mice immunized intramuscularly without adjuvant. Two weeks after the final boost, we observed a significantly higher IgG response in S1-hFTHC immunized mice compared with the S1 immunized mice, and results from the virus neutralization assay revealed robust virus neutralization activity in the S1-hFTHC immunized group compared to the S1 immunized group. Furthermore, analysis of the serum based on IgG and neutralizing titers 40 days after the last vaccination revealed the significance and longevity of the immune response induced by S1-hFTCH compared to S1 only. This strategy elucidates the efficacy of combined vaccine strategies for developing promising vaccine candidates against PEDV.\n",

            "FDA-approved antivirals against HCMV have several limitations, including only targeting the later stages of the viral replication cycle, adverse side effects, and the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Antivirals targeting host factors specifically activated within infected cells and necessary for viral replication could address the current drawbacks of anti-HCMV standard-of-care drugs. In this study, we found HCMV infection stimulated the activation of the stress response transcription factor heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1). HCMV entry into fibroblasts rapidly increased HSF1 activity and subsequent relocalization from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, which was maintained throughout viral replication and in contrast to the transient burst of activity induced by canonical heat shock. Prophylactic pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion of HSF1 prior to HCMV infection attenuated the expression of all classes of viral genes, including immediate early (IE) genes, and virus production, suggesting HSF1 promotes the earliest stages of the viral replication cycle. Therapeutic treatment with SISU-102, an HSF1 inhibitor tool compound, after IE expression also reduced the levels of L proteins and progeny production, suggesting HSF1 regulates multiple steps along the HCMV replication cycle. Leveraging a newly developed human skin xenograft transplant murine model, we found prophylactic treatment with SISU-102 significantly attenuated viral replication in transplanted human skin xenografts as well as viral dissemination to distal sites. These data demonstrate HCMV infection rapidly activates and relocalizes HSF1 to the nucleus to promote viral replication, which can be exploited as a host-directed antiviral strategy.\n",

            "Influenza A virus (IAV) is a respiratory pathogen that causes seasonal outbreaks and periodic pandemics. As frequent mutations in the IAV viral genome often render vaccines ineffective or inefficient in preventing the latest outbreak, there is a need to explore other preventive strategies to control the disease. This study sought to investigate the use of antiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA), delivered by a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV), for the prevention of IAV infections. Conserved regions with less than 10% of variation were identified from IAV genome sequences deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database between 2000 and 2023. The shRNA targeting these conserved sequences was transcribed from the human RNA polymerase III U6 promoter in an AAV system. This study demonstrates that AAV delivery of shRNA against IAV genes encoding two of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunits, PB1 and PB2, inhibits the replication of IAV H1N1 and H3N2 viruses in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Delivered shPB1 to lung tissue in mice through AAV also provided effective protection against IAV infection. These results offer support for a shRNA-based strategy of influenza prevention.\n",

            "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have the potential to modulate immune responses via their cargo molecules and are being explored as vehicles in cancer immunotherapy. Dendritic cell-derived EVs can induce antigen-specific immune responses leading to reduced tumor burden. This response was shown to depend partially on B cells. EVs can be targeted to certain cells or tissues, and EVs from Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infected cells were shown to carry the EV glycoprotein GP350 on their surface and target human CD21 (hCD21) on B cells. We therefore investigated whether targeting EVs to B cells via this mechanism could improve antigen-specific immune responses. A soluble fusion protein containing the phosphatidylserine-binding domain (C1C2) of lactadherin and hCD21-binding domain (D123) of GP350 was used to decorate and target EVs to B cells. D123-decorated EVs increased in vitro B cell targeting 5-fold compared to EVs decorated with a non-targeting control protein or undecorated EVs. Furthermore, in vivo, D123-decoration did not alter the biodistribution of EVs across organs but specifically targeted them to B cells in the spleen, blood and lymph nodes of hCD21-transgenic mice. Immunization with hCD21-targeted, OVA-loaded EVs resulted in a higher percentage of antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells compared to untargeted EVs. Our data show that D123-decorated EVs efficiently target B cells and improve antigen-specific T cell responses in vivo, which could be explored in future therapeutic applications.\n",

            "Brome mosaic virus (BMV) is a tripartite positive-stranded RNA plant virus. The genomic RNA2 encodes the 2a protein, which has conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase motifs and is required for viral RNA replication. In this study, we have used two BMV strains, F and KU5, and identified two key amino acid residues, 776R and 784T, in the C-terminal non-conserved region of the 2a protein that are critical for systemic infection of BMV-F in rice. While KU5 strain was not able to systemically infect rice, the KU5 mutant strain with two codon changes for 776R and 784T in the 2a gene gained the ability to establish systemic infection in rice, which affects long-distance movement, but not replication or cell-to-cell movement. Through infection assays of KU5 synonymous mutant strains, we demonstrated that amino acids, rather than RNA sequences or secondary structures, are responsible for viral infectivity in rice. Computer predictions and yeast two-hybrid screening revealed that the C-terminal region of 2a functions as an intrinsically disordered region, capable of interacting with host proteins. These results provide molecular insights into the host specificity of BMV and advance our understanding of RNA virus evolution and host-pathogen interactions.\n",

However, the question of whether ASFV genomic DNA enters the nucleus has been a subject of debate. In this study, DNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) technology was employed to trace the genomic DNA of ASFV. Specific probes targeting the DNA of the ASFV HLJ/18 strain were designed and synthesized, facilitating the successful detection of ASFV DNA in ASFV-infected porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Detection of ASFV genomic DNA commenced as early as 2&#x202f;h post-infection (hpi), with a progressive increase in DNA signals over time. At 8 hpi, ASFV DNA predominantly localized around nuclear virus factories (VFs), and with continued viral replication increased, the fluorescence signals associated with the detected DNA intensified and extended to additional cytoplasmic areas beyond the VFs. After 20 hpi, the fluorescence signals reached a state of stabilization. Furthermore, confocal Z-stack imaging revealed that ASFV DNA signals were absent from the nucleus throughout all the stages of ASFV infection, providing substantial evidence regarding ASFV genome localization.\n",

Limited information is available regarding the possibility of water contamination and the role of this milieu in dissemination of the PRRS virus. In this study, the survivability of the PRRSV in tap water at three temperatures (4&#xb0;C, 21-23&#xb0;C, and 37&#xb0;C) was assessed. Tap water obtained from a laboratory faucet underwent different treatments involving autoclaving and dechlorination. Four strains of PRRSV-2 (L1A 1-7-4, L1C 1-4-4&#x202f;SD, L9 1-4-2, L5 2-5-2) and one of PRRSV-1 (Lelystad), grown in the MARC-145 cell line with titers ranging from 4.0 to 5.5 log10 TCID50/0.1 mL, were added to the water samples followed by incubation at different temperatures. At various times, the samples were removed and titrated in cell cultures to determine the amount of viable virus. While there were no major differences between virus strains and water treatments, results showed a statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01) prolonged survivability at lower temperatures: all strains remained viable for over 28 days at 4&#xb0;C, 3-7 days at 21-23&#xb0;C, and more than&#x202f;24 hour sat 37&#xb0;C. The time required for a 99% decrease in virus titer (T<sub>99</sub>) further confirmed its longer survivability at lower temperatures, and the comparisons among these results indicate a potential risk of drinking tap water as a PRRSV carrier in farms, especially at lower temperatures.\n",

Sirtuins are NAD+ dependent protein deacylases involved in the regulation of several important biological processes ranging from energy homeostasis, metabolism, aging, apoptosis, autophagy, immunity, adipocyte, and muscle differentiation. Here, in this review, we discuss the role of sirtuins in several infectious diseases including viral, bacterial, and protozoan infections with detailed emphasis on bacterial-host interactions. We have aimed to explore both host and bacterial sirtuin functions contributing to the infection progression, host responses and their influence on the everlasting host-pathogen tug-of-war. In order to manipulate host pathways, pathogens such as intracellular bacteria have evolved parallelly and harbor bacterial sirtuins. The recent discoveries of bacterial sirtuins influencing the host-pathogen interaction outcomes pave the way for the discovery of potential therapeutic targets.\n",

            "Background Kazakhstan has a high HIV incidence among adolescents and young adults (AYA), and high HIV stigma contributing to low HIV testing uptake. We examined whether an AYA-developed digital crowdsourced intervention reduced HIV stigma compared with conventional public health materials among AYA in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Methods A total of 216 AYA (females:116/males:110) aged 16-24 years were recruited to the online study cohort and randomized 1:1 to the intervention or control arm. AYA were exposed to the crowdsourced intervention or control materials once a week for 5weeks, with equivalent exposures between arms. Outcomes included a total HIV stigma score assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention and 2months post-intervention from January to August 2023. We conducted multilevel mixed models to compare changes over time by arm and sex. Results AYA in the intervention arm had significantly lower HIV testing stigma 2months post-intervention (adjusted mean change (AMC): -0.73 (-1.07, -0.39)) than AYA in the control arm (AMC: -0.06 (-0.42, 0.30); P =0.032). Female AYA in the intervention arm had significantly lower total HIV stigma immediately post-intervention (AMC: -4.91 (-7.25, -2.58)) and 2months post-intervention (AMC: -5.16 (-7.48, -2.84)) than females in the control arm (immediately post-intervention AMC: -0.03 (-2.63, 2.57) and 2-months post-intervention AMC: -0.07 (-2.70, 2.56); P =0.012, P =0.012). Conclusions The AYA-developed crowdsourced intervention decreased HIV testing stigma, although this effect was moderated by sex, and decreased total HIV stigma among female AYA. Crowdsourced interventions may be a promising way to engage communities to develop interventions to decrease HIV stigma.\n",

            "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a highly contagious virus that poses a significant threat to the global pig farming industry, resulting in substantial economic losses. However, owing to the high variability of PRRSV and unclear mechanisms of infection, there are currently no effective vaccines or drugs available for its prevention and control. Our previous report revealed that highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) requires the FAK-PI3K-AKT signaling pathway to facilitate its entry into cells. In this study, we further investigated whether the integrin subunit was involved in the entry process of NADC30-like PRRSV. First, the integrin subunits in Marc-145 cells were characterized by RT-PCR, and 11 of these subunits were identified, nearly all of which interacted with the integrin &#x3b1; V and &#x3b2;1 subunits to form heterodimers. Western blot analysis revealed that the integrin &#x3b1; V subunit was highly expressed in Marc-145 cells, and blocking this subunit with a functional antibody or siRNA significantly attenuated NADC30-like PRRSV entry without affecting virus binding. Moreover, in Marc-145 cells, NADC30-like PRRSV could activate the FAK-PI3K-AKT signaling pathway through the integrin &#x3b1; V subunit. Blocking the &#x3b1; V subunit significantly inhibited signal transduction and virus entry, and treatment of cells with the PI3K activator greatly reversed this inhibitory effect. Furthermore, the &#x3b1; V subunit activator manganese could also enhance NADC30-like PRRSV entry and signal transduction. In conclusion, our results revealed that NADC30-like PRRSV could activate the integrin &#x3b1; V subunit and subsequently transduce signals to the FAK-PI3K-AKT signaling pathway to facilitate entry into Marc-145 cells.\n",

We aimed to identify and characterize DENV co-infection patterns in field-caught mosquitoes and dengue patients. This study was conducted in northeastern Thailand between June 2016 to August 2019. Female Aedes mosquitos collected from and around dengue patient's houses were analyzed for DENV infection and presence of serotypes using RT-PCR. DENV serotyping was successful in 154 (39.49%) of human and 165 (14.26%) of mosquito samples. Prevalence of DENV co-infection in patients and mosquitoes was 22.73% (35 cases) and 28.48% (47 samples), respectively. Co-infection with multiple serotypes were double (human 88.57%, mosquito 89.36%), triple (human 5.72%, mosquito 10.64%) and quadruple (human 5.72%, mosquito 0%) infections. Concurrent infection was different between hosts and concurrence patterns of DENV serotype in each host mostly composed of the predominant serotype of the detected year. This is the first report that show DENV co-infection patterns in field-caught mosquito and in dengue fever patients with combinations of triple and quadruple serotypes in Thailand. These finding are potentially useful for understanding shifts in serotypes, concurrent DENV infection patterns, vaccine development, and further research on the ability of vectors to transmit multiple serotypes.\n",

            "Building upon the Job Demands-Resources model, this study examines the relationships among precarious work schedules, work attendance anxiety, and employer support during the early COVID-19 pandemic. For part-time retail workers, the prevalence of precarious work schedules has been a persistent problem. Additionally, new challenges such as work attendance anxiety and lack of employer support emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected through an online survey on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. Between July and August 2020, we secured a sample of U.S. part-time workers in \"food and beverage retail stores\" (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;179). Using Ordinary Least Squares regression analyses, we find that work attendance anxiety, lack of control over work hours, and non-standard working hours are negatively associated with job satisfaction. In terms of employer support, personal protective equipment is associated with lower levels of work attendance anxiety and alleviates the impact of work attendance anxiety on job satisfaction. The findings provide valuable insights for employers and managers aiming to enhance job satisfaction and effectively respond to challenges posed by health crises.\n",

Universal screening is recommended for all adults aged &#x2265;18 years and pregnant women during each pregnancy; periodic risk-based screening also is recommended. Persons with current infection should be linked to antiviral treatment, which usually results in a virologic cure within 8-12 weeks. To assess progress toward elimination, epidemiologic trends in newly reported chronic hepatitis C cases were assessed among adult Alaska residents during 2016-2023. Overall, 5,352 confirmed chronic hepatitis C cases were newly reported among adults aged &#x2265;18 years. The average annual rate (cases per 100,000 population) was 121 and decreased a relative 30% from 142 during 2016-2019 to 99 during 2020-2023. Statistically significant decreases occurred for most groups. Groups with higher average rates included males, adults aged 18-39 years, residents of rural areas, and American Indian or Alaska Native persons. Hepatitis C surveillance can help monitor trends in health outcomes and identify groups needing tailored testing and treatment interventions toward hepatitis C elimination.\n",

            "Parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) is a paramyxovirus that has been isolated from numerous mammalian hosts and is notable for its ability to cause persistent infections. Although PIV5-infected cells are resistant to IFN due to the ability of the V protein to target STAT1 for degradation, PIV5 shows residual IFN sensitivity when infecting cells that have already been exposed to IFN. We have previously reported that the human IFN-stimulated gene with the greatest inhibitory effect on PIV5 is IFIT1. IFIT1 inhibits the translation of incompletely methylated mRNAs (Cap0) but not those 2'-O-methylated at the first transcribed nucleotide (Cap1). All <i>Mononegavirales</i> are thought to generate Cap1 mRNA, so the sensitivity of PIV5 to IFIT1 is surprising. Here, we show that PIV5 generates Cap0 mRNA but not Cap1 mRNA, thus explaining its sensitivity to IFIT1. Furthermore, the sensitivity of different PIV5 genes to IFIT1-mediated translation inhibition varies. In the absence of complete Cap methylation, we show that the presence or absence of 5'-terminal RNA hairpin structures in the 5'UTRs of PIV5 genes determines the extent to which they are sensitive to IFIT1. Notably, the genes involved in RNA synthesis are relatively resistant to IFIT1 inhibition. This presents a potential mechanism by which IFIT1 can regulate the outcome of PIV5 infection in response to IFN and may be important in allowing the virus to establish prolonged/persistent infections.\n",

            "The influenza virus causes approximately hundreds of thousands of deaths annually. Coupled with the emergence of drug resistance, there is an urgent need to develop new drugs for the treatment of influenza. Neuraminidase (NA) has long been recognized as a valid drug target for anti-influenza therapy. Herein, in order to identify potential NA inhibitors with novel structures, we employed a structure-based virtual screening strategy to screen a library containing 1.6 million compounds. Based on XP docking score and free energy calculation results, the three compounds E570-1769, K788-4718, and C071-0424 were selected that may have better binding affinity for the NA protein compared to oseltamivir. Amongst, E570-1769 was identified to be the most potential hit. Docking study showed that E570-1769 bound to NA with a binding energy of -10.3&#x2009;kcal/mol. Moreover, in silico ADME/T studies demonstrated the druggability of E570-1769 was quite well. Furthermore, in vitro assay demonstrated that E570-1769 inhibited the wild-type and H274Y-muatated NAs with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 72.6&#x2009;&#x3bc;M and 229&#x2009;&#x3bc;M, respectively. Additionally, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation studies were performed to gain a deep insight into the binding modes of E570-1769 in complex with NA. While less potent than oseltamivir, the novel structure of E570-1769 and promising ADME/T properties indicates it as a promising lead for future research.\n",

            "With the widespread prevalence of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) globally, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and the Mediterranean region, the open reading frame (ORF) K1 gene, a key gene for distinguishing different subtypes of KSHV, has been extensively studied for its diversity and sequence variations. In this study, we collected K1 gene sequences representing subtypes of KSHV worldwide in order to assess the global distribution of KSHV subtypes and to investigate the recombination and selection history of KSHV. Recombination and gene flow analysis indicated a minimum average recombination rate of 0.41 per site for the K1 gene. Recombination analysis indicated that 11 major recombination events had occurred, predominantly in subtypes A and C, while subtype B showed minimal involvement in recombination processes, consistent with the gene flow analysis. Using tip-dating methods, we estimated that the most recent common ancestor of KSHV emerged in the 12th century, while the currently globally prevalent subtypes appeared within the past three centuries. Its recent origin and rapid evolution indicate that KSHV is now undergoing strong selection and is in the process of adaptation.\n",

The Beddington-DeAngelis incidence rate is used to evaluate the effectiveness of inhibitory measures implemented by susceptible and infected individuals. Moreover, the choice of Holling type II treatment rate in our model aims to assess the impact of limited treatment facilities in the context of disease outbreaks. First, the well-posed nature of the model is analyzed, and then, we further investigated the local and global stability analysis along with bifurcation of co-dimensions 1 (transcritical, Hopf, saddle-node) and 2 (Bogdanov-Takens, generalized Hopf) for the system. Moreover, we incorporate a time-delayed model to investigate the effect of incubation delay on disease transmission. We provide a rigorous demonstration of the existence of chaos and establish the conditions that lead to chaotic dynamics and chaos control. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is performed using partial rank correlation coefficient and extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test methods. Furthermore, we delve into optimal control strategies using Pontryagin's maximum principle and assess the influence of delays in state and control parameters on model dynamics. Again, a stochastic epidemic model is formulated and analyzed using a continuous-time Markov chain model for infectious propagation. Analytical estimation of the likelihood of disease extinction and the occurrence of an epidemic is conducted using the branching process approximation. The spatial system presents a comprehensive stability analysis and yielding criteria for Turing instability. Moreover, we have generated the noise-induced pattern to assess the effect of white noise in the populations. Additionally, a case study has been conducted to estimate the model parameters, utilizing COVID-19 data from Poland and HIV/AIDS data from India. Finally, all theoretical results are validated through numerical simulations. This article extensively explores various modeling techniques, like deterministic, stochastic, statistical, pattern formation(noise-induced), model fitting, and other modeling perspectives, highlighting the significance of the inhibitory effects exerted by susceptible and infected populations.\n",

            "Acute human alpha-herpesvirus 1 (HSV-1) infection leads to infection of neurons within trigeminal ganglia (TG), brainstem, and other regions of the central nervous system. Lytic cycle viral gene expression is subsequently silenced, a subset of neurons survive infection, and life-long latency is established. In contrast to lytic infection, the latency-associated transcript (LAT) is the only viral gene product abundantly expressed in latently infected neurons. Stress (acute or chronic), UV light, or heat stress increases the incidence of reactivation from latency in humans and mouse models of infection. Ironically, these divergent reactivation stimuli activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Recent studies revealed GR and Kr&#xfc;ppel-like factors (KLF), KLF4 or KLF15 for example, cooperatively transactivate the infected cell protein 0 (ICP0) promoter and cis-regulatory motifs that activate ICP4 and ICP27 promoter activity. GR and KLF4 are \"pioneer transcription factors\" that specifically bind DNA even when it exists as heterochromatin; consequently, chromatin is remodeled, and transcription is activated. Conversely, a VP16 cis-regulatory motif is transactivated by GR and Slug but not KLF family members. Female mice that express a GR containing a serine &#x2192; alanine mutation at position 229 (GR<sup>S229A</sup>) shed significantly lower HSV-1 levels compared with age-matched male GR<sup>S229A</sup> mice or wild-type parental C57BL/6 mice during reactivation from latency. These observations imply GR and stress-induced cellular transcription factors play an important role during reactivation from latency by activating key viral promoters. GR activation may also enhance virus spread by impairing immune and inflammatory responses.\n",

However, the importance of epitope specificity for these protective antibodies and how skewed responses contribute to the development of acute and chronic CHIKV-associated joint disease remains poorly understood.

Characterization of the virus library revealed achievement of high diversity while also selecting out nonfunctional virus variants.

            "Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a porcine alphaherpesvirus that can infect different animal species and cause pruritus and lethal encephalitis. Stress granules (SGs) are membrane-free cytoplasmic structures formed by liquid-liquid phase separation of G3BP proteins during cell translation inhibition, which generally plays an antiviral role in various viral infections. In this study, we found that infection with different PRV strains inhibits the formation of SGs in host cells. We found that IE180, the only immediate early protein of PRV, has a distinct inhibitory effect on SG formation and colocalizes with SG-nucleating G3BP proteins (G3BP1/2) in the nucleus during PRV infection. Co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated an interaction between IE180 and G3BP1/G3BP2, and this interaction appears to depend on the Herpesvirus ICP4-like protein N-terminal (ICP4L-N) domain of IE180 and both NTF2L and RBD domains of G3BP1. Since G3BPs mainly function in the cytoplasm to induce SG formation, we constructed several IE180 protein truncations lacking a nuclear localization sequence to alter the subcellular localization of IE180 to the cytoplasm. Mutant IE180 protein was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm and still suppressed SG formation induced by arsenite or poly(I:C), but its ability to inhibit SG formation was weakened. Importantly, knockout of G3BPs facilitated PRV replication in H1299 cells, while exogenous expression of G3BPs and formation of SGs in wild-type H1299 cells suppressed PRV replication. In summary, our study indicates that PRV IE180 suppresses SG formation and hijacks G3BPs into the nucleus to benefit virus replication.IMPORTANCEHerpesviruses, including pseudorabies virus (PRV), have evolved different strategies to compromise host immune responses. Stress granules (SGs) are one of the targets that viruses can overcome in order to increase replication. The related herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) inhibits SG formation to promote virus replication, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we confirmed that infection with different PRV strains inhibits SG formation. Interestingly, we found that the PRV immediate early protein IE180 interacts with G3BP proteins and hijacks these proteins into the nucleus to prevent SG formation. In line with the antiviral effect of SGs on PRV replication, exogenous expression of G3BPs and formation of SGs in G3BP1/2 knockout H1299 cells significantly compromised PRV replication. The reported mechanism appears to be also utilized by HSV-1 to prevent SG formation. Therefore, our study elucidates a novel mechanism by which alphaherpesviruses inhibit SG formation, which provides a new perspective to inquire into the immune escape of PRV and other alphaherpesviruses.\n",

            "One characteristic of the HIV-1 CRF01_AE strain is that it contains a bulkier histidine residue at position 375 (H375) in its envelope glycoproteins (Env). This residue is part of the Phe43 cavity, where residue 43 of CD4 engages with gp120. It has been shown that H375 contributes to resistance against small molecule inhibitors targeting gp120. Residue 375 co-evolved with a few residues of the gp120 inner domain layers, and together they modulate the susceptibility of Env to small molecule gp120 inhibitors. Since residue 629 within the HR2 region of gp41 has also been proposed to have co-evolved with residue 375, we explored its role in the susceptibility of HIV-1 Env to two classes of small molecule gp120 inhibitors: the conformational blocker temsavir and the CD4-mimetic (CD4mc) BNM-III-170. Reversion of CRF01_AE isoleucine to a major clade methionine at position 629 had a significant but opposite impact on the susceptibility of the virus to temsavir and BNM-III-170. Mechanistically, this is associated with the capacity of residue 629 to modulate Env stability, as attested by its impact on cold inactivation. Overall, our results show how a single residue of HR2 contributes to the overall Env trimer stability and its susceptibility to gp120-targeted small molecule inhibitors.IMPORTANCECRF01_AE envelope glycoproteins (Env) have a well-conserved histidine at position 375.

The ASIR of AHC was similar in males and females, while females had higher ASMR and ASDR than males. The highest ASIR was observed in children under 5&#x2009;years of age. Additionally, a negative association was found between the ASIR, ASMR, ASDR of AHC and sociodemographic index values at the regional and national levels. Our findings underscore the persistent severity of the global burden of AHC; effective and targeted strategies are needed to reduce the overall burden.\n",

This review investigates the dual roles of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) in SARS-CoV-2 infection among cancer patients. ACE2, the vital entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is overexpressed in certain tumors such as colon adenocarcinoma, renal carcinomas, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma, potentially increasing viral susceptibility. Paradoxically, ACE2 also exhibits tumor-suppressive properties by inhibiting angiogenesis and modulating the tumor microenvironment, leading to improved patient prognoses in some cancers like breast cancer. TMPRSS2, essential for viral entry, shows decreased expression in several tumors but acts as a prognostic biomarker in prostate and lung cancers. This review illustrates the complexity of therapeutically targeting ACE2 and TMPRSS2 due to their contrasting roles in cancer progression and viral entry. We analyze the expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in relation to immune cell infiltration and patient outcomes, and propose personalized therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, we underscore the necessity for multidisciplinary approaches, integrating antiviral treatments with cancer therapies and tailoring interventions based on individual molecular profiles. This approach to personalized medicine seeks to enhance treatment results and better manage cancer patients who have contracted SARS-CoV-2.\n",

            "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common throughout the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum and profoundly affect patients, caregivers, and health-care systems. This review synthesizes key research presented in the 2022 and 2023 Alzheimer's Association International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment Neuropsychiatric Syndromes-Professional Interest Area (NPS-PIA) Year-In-Reviews, emphasizing six critical areas: (1) diversity and disparities, (2) diagnostic frameworks, (3) neurobiology of NPS, (4) NPS as a disease marker, (5) the impact of COVID-19, and (6) interventions. NPS accelerates AD progression, increases functional decline, diminishes quality of life, and heightens caregiver burden and institutionalization rates. Current treatments primarily rely on psychotropics, which offer limited efficacy and raise safety concerns. This review aims to inform clinicians and researchers about recent NPS advancements while identifying gaps for future studies to improve outcomes for individuals with AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Research in Alzheimer's disease-related neuropsychiatric symptoms has rapidly increased, indicating heightened interest. Key areas include: diversity, diagnostics, markers, COVID-19 impact, and treatments. A road map for future studies, based on the key areas of research, is provided. This road map includes considerations to improve study applicability and validity.\n",

            "Dengue, a mosquito-borne disease caused by the dengue virus (DENV), is constantly expanding worldwide. We investigated the presence and persistence of DENV RNA in the bloodstream and other body fluids to describe the viral kinetics in the human host. We longitudinally collected serum (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;118), plasma (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;110), whole blood (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;90), urine (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;118), oral swabs (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;68), saliva (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;42), semen (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;23), and vaginal fluids (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;49) from 42 DENV patients. We measured DENV RNA for a median of 28 (range 1-63) days from symptom onset (DSO). We estimated the probability of viral detection applying a generalized linear model, and the duration of viremia using Monte Carlo-Markov Chain approach. In the bloodstream, the highest rate of positivity, levels of DENV RNA, and persistence were observed in whole blood. The estimated probability of a positive test dropped below 5% after 12.5, 20.7, and 35.4 DSO for plasma, serum, and whole blood, respectively. The average duration of viremia was estimated to be 19.9 DSO. Saliva and oral swabs showed 76.2% and 58.8% of DENV RNA positivity during the first week of symptoms while the longest persistence was observed in urine (39 DSO). DENV was revealed in 20% cervicovaginal (up to 11 DSO) and 30% seminal (up to 35 DSO) fluids. Whole blood represents the preferential specimen for dengue molecular detection and the correct estimation of viremia duration which have clear implications for onward transmission and public health countermeasures. Blood, urine, and oral samples can be assayed according to time from disease onset, severity, and screening purposes.\n",

            "The detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus H5N1 in dairy cows in the United States underscores the urgent need for reliable laboratory tools to support epidemiological surveillance. This study describes the development and evaluation of a fluorescent microsphere immunoassay (FMIA) for detecting IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies against the H5 hemagglutinin protein in serum and milk samples from dairy cattle, with results compared to the NP-ELISA. H5/FMIA demonstrated 100% diagnostic sensitivity and 99.7% diagnostic specificity for anti-H5 IgG antibodies in serum. In milk samples, the assay showed comparable performance for IgG and IgA, achieving 94.7% sensitivity and 98% specificity. Paired serum and milk samples exhibited stronger correlations using H5/FMIA (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.88 for IgG, r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.82 for IgA, and r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.58 for IgM) than NP-ELISA (r&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.54). H5/FMIA IgA showed greater sensitivity in \"early\" infections, whereas IgG was more robust in \"late\" cases. These findings confirm the utility of H5/FMIA as a valuable antibody isotype-specific tool for serodiagnosis and epidemiological surveillance of H5N1 in dairy cattle.\n",

            "The development of broad-spectrum universal influenza vaccines and optimization of vaccination strategies to address the threats posed by pandemics and emerging influenza viruses are critical for public health. In this study, an adenovirus type 5 vector-based influenza vaccine carrying the hemagglutinin (HA) stem of H1, HA stem of H3, and neuraminidase (NA) of N1 from the influenza virus was constructed. Immune responses were evaluated in mice using various vaccination strategies: prime-only (intramuscular [IM] or intranasal [IN]) and prime-boost (IM&#x2009;+&#x2009;IN). Compared with the prime-only strategy, the prime-boost strategy significantly enhanced the systemic immune response, inducing higher levels of antigen-specific IgG, mucosal IgA, and T cell immunity in the spleen and lungs. Furthermore, the IN boosting strategy provided complete protection in mice challenged with the H1N1-PR8, rgH3N2-X31, and rgH5N1-Vietnam viruses, significantly reducing viral loads in the lungs and alleviating lung tissue pathologies. In conclusion, this study elucidates potential avenues for the development and application of universal influenza vaccines using customized mucosal boosting strategies.\n",

            "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common virus to affect the recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). HCMV reactivation increases the risk of secondary fungal and bacterial infections, as well as that of non-relapse mortality after allo-HSCT. This study investigates the post-transplantation reconstitution of HCMV-specific T cells and their role in the regulation of HCMV infections. Peripheral blood samples from CMV-seropositive allo-HSCT recipients (R+) and CMV-seropositive donors (D+) were collected from October 2019 to June 2021. Continuous quantification and function monitoring of CMV-specific CD4+/CD8+T lymphocytes were performed by flow cytometry after stimulation in an HCMV-pp65 pool <i>in vitro</i> and intracellular cytokine staining was performed. Plasma CMV-DNA was quantitatively detected by qPCR. The median age of patients (<i>n</i> = 131) was 34 (23-45) years. Post-transplantation HCMV reactivation occurred in 88 (67.2%) patients. HCMV-responsive CD4+T cells in non-HCMV reactivation patients was significantly higher than that in HCMV reactivation patients 30 days after transplantation (0.21 cells/&#x3bc;L vs 0.10 cells/&#x3bc;L; <i>P</i> = 0.005). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the incidence of HCMV reactivation in patients with low levels of HCMV-responsive CD4+T cells (&lt;0.14 cells/&#x3bc;L) was significantly higher than that in patients with high levels of HCMV-responsive CD4+T cells (&gt;0.14 cells/&#x3bc;L) (83.9% vs 54.7%; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Patients lacking HCMV-responsive CD8+T cells (&lt;2 cells/&#x3bc;L) 60 days after allo-HSCT had a significantly higher risk of HCMV reactivation 100 days after transplantation (<i>HR</i> 9.932; <i>P</i> = 0.005). Patient age and the mononuclear cell-infusion level were correlated with the reconstructive levels of HCMV-responsive CD8+T cells 60 days after transplantation. Poor recovery of HCMV-responsive CD4+T cells 30 days post-transplantation is closely related to the risk of HCMV reactivation. The level of HCMV-responsive CD8+T cells 60 days post-transplantation is a good predictor for late-onset HCMV reactivation, which is particularly important for outpatient monitoring and management of patients with allo-HSCT, and facilitates individualized risk stratification for HCMV reactivation.\n",

            "Recent efforts in vaccine development have targeted spike proteins from evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants. In this study, we analyzed T cell responses to the XBB.1.5 and BA.2.86 subvariants in individuals who previously received bivalent vaccines containing mRNA for ancestral and BA.5 spike proteins. T cell-mediated cytokine responses to spike proteins from both variants were largely preserved. To determine the mechanism of this preserved recognition, we utilized the functional expansion of specific T cells (FEST) assay to distinguish between the presence of T cells that cross-recognized ancestral and variant epitopes versus distinct populations of T cells that were mono-reactive for ancestral or variant epitopes. We found the majority of spike-specific T cells cross-recognized the ancestral spike and the XBB.1.5 and BA.2.86 subvariants, with less than 10% of T cells being mono-reactive for either variant. Interestingly, immunization with the XBB.1.5 monovalent booster vaccine did not significantly increase the percentage of XBB.1.5 mono-reactive T cells. Our results suggest a potential limitation in the induction of mono-reactive T cell responses by variant-specific booster vaccines.\n",

            "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), an elaborate cellular organelle that interweaves the cytosol, nucleus, mitochondria and plasma membrane, is essential for cell function and survival. Disruption of ER function can trigger unfolded protein response (UPR), which is activated by ER stress (ERS). In this study, we investigated the role of ERS in cell apoptosis induced by duck hepatitis A virus type 1 (DHAV-1) infection. Our findings revealed that DHAV-1 infection led to the activation of ERS. Specially, the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) was upregulated, activating two pathways of UPR: the protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway and the inositol-requiring enzyme 1(IRE1) pathway. Consequently, phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (p-eIF2&#x3b1;) was increased, and transcription factor 4 (ATF4) was up-regulated, resulting in the induction of the apoptotic C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). DHAV-1-infected cells exhibited various apoptotic phenotypes, including growth arrest, induction of the DNA damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34), activation of caspase-3, and suppression of antiapoptotic protein B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2). Importantly, inhibition of PERK or protein kinase R (PKR) activity suppressed CHOP activation and DHAV-1 replication, indicating that the PERK/PKR-eIF2&#x3b1; pathway played a crucial role in ERS-induced apoptosis. Collectively, our study provides novel insights into the mechanism of DHAV-1-induced apoptosis and reveals a potential defense mechanism against DHAV-1 replication.\n",

            "Most cases of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection (VL/HIV) in the Americas occur in Brazil, and the prevalence of VL/HIV has been increasing since 2019, reaching 19% in 2023. This association presents a challenge for the management of VL, since both VL and HIV infection share immunopathogenic characteristics that can reciprocally affect co-infected patients. Thus, VL may contribute to the immunosuppression and other immunological disturbances associated with the rapid progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), whereas HIV infection accelerates the development of active VL and reduces the probability of a successful response to anti-<i>Leishmania</i> therapy, resulting in an increase in the relapse and lethality rates of VL. In this synergistic impairment, one of the most critical hallmarks of VL/HIV co-infection is the enhancement of immunosuppression and intense chronic immune activation, caused not only by each infection per se, but also by the cytokine storm and translocation of microbial products. Thus, co-infected patients present with an impaired effector immune response that may result in inefficient parasitic control. In addition, the chronic activation environment in VL/HIV patients may favor progression to early immunosenescence and exhaustion, worsening the patients' clinical condition and increasing the frequency of disease relapse. Herein, we review the immunological parameters associated with the immunopathogenesis of VL/HIV co-infection that could serve as good biomarkers of clinical prognosis in terms of relapse and severity of VL.\n",

In this study, we investigated the neurological sequelae and explored the potential association between post COVID-19 conditions and the development of Parkinson's disease-like symptoms by conducting a questionnaire survey on patients with COVID-19. We surveyed patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and visited the outpatient service of the institution from February 2020 to November 2021. Demographic and clinical data and data regarding the presence and duration of post COVID-19 conditions were obtained. The most common symptom was insomnia, experienced by 141 participants (27.9%). Bradykinesia was the next most common symptom, experienced by 66 participants (13.1%). Moreover, 18 (3.6%) participants reported persistence for &gt; 180 days. Notably, the median duration of bradykinesia was 90 days. The proportions of patients with dysbasia, resting tremor, not previously noted constipation, and somniloquy were 9.1%, 5.0%, 4.8%, and 2.8%, respectively. Few participants had any of these symptoms lasting for more than 180 days. None of the participants was first diagnosed with PD, other neurological diseases, or dementia after COVID-19.

            "Towards the WHO goal for hepatitis elimination, understanding the prevalence and management of hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV) among drug abusers is crucial. However, in Japan, where drug abuse is less prevalent than in other countries, there is a dearth of epidemiological studies on this topic. This study aimed to fill this gap by investigating virus prevalence and the testing and treatment landscape for drug abusers in Japan. We conducted a cross-sectional sero-epidemiological study at a psychiatric hospital in Hiroshima where approaching drug abusers was feasible. Blood samples and questionnaire on HBV/HCV testing and treatment were collected from drug abusers (<i>n</i> = 35, 85.7% male, mean age 55.4 years) and control group (<i>n</i> = 45, 71.1%, 48.2 years). Prevalence of HCV-Ab and HCV RNA in drug abusers was 60.0% (95% CI: 43.8-76.2%) and 28.6% (13.6-43.5%), respectively, which was significantly higher than in the control group (2.2%, 0.0%, respectively). All HCV-Ab positive drug abusers had undergone prior hepatitis virus testing, but only 42.9% of those eligible for HCV treatment were connected to it. For HBV, while prevalence of HBsAg was similar between groups (2.9% <i>vs</i>. 2.2%), prevalence of HBc-Ab was higher in drug abusers (34.3% <i>vs.</i> 17.8%), indicating a greater likelihood of exposure to HBV infection. In conclusion, HCV prevalence among drug abusers in psychiatric care is notably high. Although testing is accessible, a recognized challenge is the insufficient connection to treatment. Enhancing collaboration between psychiatric hospitals and hepatologists is crucial. Disregarding this issue is not an option for hepatitis elimination.\n",

The aim of this qualitative study is to explore and understand the lived experiences of individuals living with HIV and visual impairment in Lira District, Northern Uganda, specifically focusing on their access to antiretroviral therapy services. Additionally, the study is aimed at identifying and analyzing the coping strategies employed by this population in navigating the intersectionality of HIV and visual impairment. <b>Methods:</b> This qualitative study, conducted in Lira District, Northern Uganda, employed a descriptive phenomenological design. Thirty in-depth interviews were conducted at Lira Regional Referral Hospital, focusing on individuals living with both HIV and visual impairment. Data collection involved a semistructured interview guide, addressing key issues derived from a literature review. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis, guided by Braun and Clarke's framework. <b>Results:</b> Participants (<i>N</i> = 30) exhibited diverse sociodemographic characteristics, with ages ranging from 19 to 68 years. A number of themes emerged during data analysis: individuals developing visual impairment before and after ART initiation. Emotional challenges, strained relationships, and perceived burdenship were common themes among participants. Limited understanding of the cause of sight loss and a heightened perceived risk of HIV infection were evident. Challenges in accessing ART services included transportation difficulties, negative attitudes from healthcare workers, and a lack of trust in community drug distribution points. Participants employed various coping strategies, including prayers/religion, reliance on social support networks, denial, acceptance, and community rehabilitation. Positive religious beliefs offered hope, while social support played a crucial role in adaptation. Community rehabilitation and support were highlighted as instrumental in aiding coping. <b>Conclusion:</b> Despite awareness about the risk of HIV infection, significant barriers persist in accessing ART services for persons with visual impairment. Coping strategies underscore the importance of addressing psychosocial aspects. Tailored interventions, education, and policy changes are imperative to enhance inclusivity and accessibility of healthcare services for this vulnerable population in Uganda.\n",

            "Monkeypox is a zoonotic viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus, an Orthopoxvirus closely related to smallpox. While historically confined to endemic regions in Africa, recent outbreaks have demonstrated its capacity to spread globally, posing significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We present the case of a 28-year-old previously healthy Caucasian male who repeatedly sought care in the emergency department (ED) for nonspecific flu-like symptoms, including fever, lymphadenopathy, dysphagia, and a progressive vesiculopustular rash. The initial lack of a clear clinical picture led to multiple misdiagnoses and treatments for presumed bacterial infections. Despite multiple evaluations and initial misdiagnoses, the persistence and progression of symptoms - including worsening lymphadenopathy, dysphagia, and a vesiculopustular rash with umbilicated lesions - raised concern for an Orthopoxvirus infection. Given the patient's history of intimate contact with a male partner who had recently traveled internationally, monkeypox became a key diagnostic consideration. Other possible differential diagnoses included bacterial tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, syphilis, varicella, and other sexually transmitted infections. This evolving clinical picture prompted expedited non-variola Orthopoxvirus DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, which ultimately confirmed the diagnosis. This report highlights the diagnostic challenges posed by monkeypox in non-endemic settings, where healthcare providers may have limited familiarity with the disease. It demonstrates the need for heightened clinical suspicion in patients with compatible symptoms, especially during outbreak periods. The patient's subsequent treatment with tecovirimat demonstrated its potential effectiveness in mitigating symptoms and improving outcomes when initiated promptly. Additionally, this report emphasizes the crucial role of public health measures, including robust surveillance systems such as enhanced case reporting, rapid diagnostic testing networks, and contact tracing programs, alongside healthcare provider education and vaccination strategies, in combating the spread of this reemerging infectious disease.\n",

Brain MRI revealed a right temporal lobulated lesion with surrounding edema and mass effect. Chronic superior sagittal sinus thrombosis and hydrocephalus were also identified. Neurosurgical intervention included ventriculocisternostomy and microsurgical resection of the lesion, which revealed a multiloculated abscess. Histology confirmed granuloma formation, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identified <i>A. israelii</i>.

            "Controversy exists around the relative merits of Fc functions in controlling or prevent-ing HIV-1 infection. Proponents point to general correlations of Fc functions with control of HIV, indicating that non-neutralizing antibodies could force immune escape, as observed in the early experiments with Fc mutants of the b12-neutralizing monoclonal antibody. Nay-sayers point to the primary role of neutralization in the control of HIV, the general failure of vaccine trials in-cluding antibodies with Fc functions, and the lack of additional benefit with newer broadly neu-tralizing monoclonal antibodies, such as PGT121. The truth may lie somewhere in between and there are lessons to be learned from the utility of Fc functions in other viral infections. In general, however, the additional benefit of Fc function over and above robust anti-HIV neutralizing anti-bodies may be modest. The intense primary research focus on delivering and inducing potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies, regardless of their Fc function potential, is justified.\n",

The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of trauma among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic, using a qualitative descriptive study design. This paper used secondary analysis of qualitative, semi-structured interviews conducted with 55 Australian nurses exploring their alcohol consumption, due to the frequent narratives of trauma and traumatic events arising during this process. Data were analysed using structural coding and reported in accordance with the Consolidated Checklist for Reporting Qualitative Data (CORE-Q guidelines). Four themes emerged during data analysis: managing the traumatic stress of the clinical environment in COVID ('it doesn't feel like it's gone away'), post-pandemic trauma ('it was like war, wasn't it?'), bonding over shared trauma ('I was not expecting the camaraderie that developed') and managing trauma after the event ('If something bad happens whilst you're on shift, you just have to pretend like it hasn't happened'). Participants in this study described lasting mental health effects from working clinically during the COVID-19 pandemic that they described as trauma. These effects have lasted since governments worldwide have announced an end to the pandemic, and although participants described bonding over these shared experiences, they continue to have a detrimental impact on workforce well-being and sustainability.\n",

In this study, we demonstrate that a single intranasal immunization with the chimpanzee adenoviral-vectored NiV vaccine, AdC68-F, induced robust and sustained cellular and humoral responses in BALB/c mice, and provided complete protection against challenge with the NiV-Malaysia strain (NiV-M) in hamsters. Notably, AdC68-F, administered at a dose of 5 &#xd7; 10<sup>9</sup> viral particles, offered a complete prophylactic protection window as short as seven days before exposure to a lethal NiV-M challenge. Furthermore, passive transfer of sera from AdC68-F or AdC68-G immunized animals conferred complete protection against NiV-M infection in na&#xef;ve hamsters. These findings underscore the pivotal role of antigen-specific immunity in controlling NiV infection and highlight the potential of single-dose intranasal AdC68-based NiV vaccines for rapid protection during outbreaks. By providing rapid and effective protection, these vaccines could help reduce human-to-human transmission and aid in curbing NiV outbreaks.\n",

Estimates also show that there is no association between the nationality of the on-field official being shared by any of the teams and sanction or match outcome. However, it is identified that having a home nationality Television Match Official (TMO) is associated with an increase in the incidence of away team sanction. The results support the case for neutral TMOs.\n",

            "The retrospective cohort study was planned to determine long-term anti-spike immunoglobulin G levels after receiving coronavirus disease-2019 vaccination by healthcare workers. The study took place between June and July 2022 at the Indus hospital in Karachi. Healthcare workers who had previously screened negative to prevaccination Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 nucleocapsid antibodies were tested for post-vaccination Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 anti-spike immunoglobulin G levels using a quantitative assay. The test was also performed on the stored pre-vaccination samples of the subjects collected up to 18 months previously. Antibody levels in subjects without infection, with infection and with booster administration were compared. The median postvaccination anti-spike immunoglobulin G in infected only, infected with routine vaccination and infected with booster values were 1,725.6 IU/mL (interquartile range: 684.80- 4,708.9 IU/mL), 2,067.15 IU/mL (interquartile range: 705.33-4,670.4 IU/mL) and 6,139.15 IU/mL (interquartile range: 2,426.05-10,623.40 IU/mL). There was a doubling of antibody titers, from 1,744 IU/mL to 3,829 IU/mL, in those who received a booster versus routine vaccination (p&gt;0.05). The antibodies remained positive more than a year following vaccination.\n",

The current study was planned to determine whether or not rituximab increases the risk and severity of coronavirus diseases-2019 infection in pemphigus vulgaris patients. The retrospective study was conducted at the Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan, and comprised data from the dermatology unit of 34 diagnosed cases of pemphigus vulgaris who received rituximab treatment from March 2020 to March 2022. The mean age of the patients was 36.58&#xb1;12.44 years. Majority of patients 28(82.3%) received rituximab as a second-line therapy, while 6(17.64%) were given it as a first-line therapy. Only 1(2.9%) patient developed mild covid pneumonia, and did not need in-patient care or faced oxygen dependence. There was a significant weak association between coronavirus diseases-2019 positivity with age (p=0.000). Rituximab therapy could be given to pemphigus patients during the pandemic, but only when necessary.\n",

            "The non-canonical functions of autophagy protein ATG16L1 are dependent on a C-terminal WD domain. Recent studies show that the WD domain is required for conjugation of LC3 to single membranes during endocytosis and phagocytosis, where it is thought to promote fusion with lysosomes. Studies in cells lacking the WD domain suggest additional roles in the regulation of cytokine receptor recycling and plasma membrane repair. The WD domain also protects mice against lethal influenza virus <i>in vivo</i>. Here, analysis of mice lacking the WD domain (&#x394;WD) shows enrichment of cholesterol in brain tissue suggesting a role for the WD domain in cholesterol transport. Brain tissue and cells from &#x394;WD mice showed reduced cholesterol and phosphatidylserine (PS) in the plasma membrane. Cells from &#x394;WD mice also showed an intracellular accumulation of cholesterol predominantly in late endosomes. Infection studies using IAV suggest that the loss of cholesterol and PS from the plasma membrane in cells from &#x394;WD mice results in increased endocytosis and nuclear delivery of IAV, as well as increased <i>Ifnb</i>/<i>Ifn&#x3b2;</i> and <i>Isg15</i> gene expression. Upregulation of <i>Il6</i>, <i>Ifnb</i> and <i>Isg15</i> mRNA were observed in \"ex vivo\" precision cut lung slices from &#x394;WD mice both at rest and in response to IAV infection. Overall, we present evidence that regulation of lipid transport by the WD domain of ATG16L1 May have downstream implications in attenuating viral infection and limiting lethal cytokine signaling.\n",

            "The global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the strategies adopted by different nations have affected and altered the transmission of different respiratory pathogens around the world. We examined the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the spread of respiratory viruses in the period between 2021 and 2024 in patients with severe influenza-like symptoms in the Lazio region using multiplex PCR tests for the identification of common seasonal respiratory viruses. Our data reveal a change in the transmission of respiratory viruses from 2021 to 2024, with a sharp decline in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and a rise in the transmission of other respiratory viruses, especially influenza viruses, and human rhinovirus/enterovirus in 2024. Moreover, viral co-infections, both those involving two viruses and those involving three viruses, have also increased. This work shows how the spread of SARS-CoV-2 influenced the spread of other respiratory viruses over four years in patients with severe influenza-like symptoms in the Lazio region. In conclusion, the resurgence and fluctuation of various respiratory viruses emphasize the dynamic nature of viral epidemiology in the post-pandemic context and highlight the ongoing need for vigilant public health monitoring and intervention strategies.\n",

            "South Africa has the highest HIV prevalence globally, often co-occurring with helminth infections in impoverished regions. The coexistence of these infections leads to immunological interactions, potentially enhancing oncogenesis by upregulating immune checkpoint molecules (ICs) among other effects. Notably, most ICs are overexpressed in cancer and correlated with its progression. Helminth infections trigger Th2-type immunity, increasing immunosuppressive M2 macrophages, regulatory T cells, and associated IC molecules. PD-L2 is reported to contribute to Th2-type immunity induced by helminth infections. Similarly, TIM-3, elevated during chronic viral infections, induces a similar immunosuppressive profile. CTLA-4 and PD-1 impact T-cell function by interacting with CD28, crucial for T-cell function. CD28 is downregulated in chronic infections and cancer. This study investigated the impact of HIV-helminth co-infection on co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecule profiles associated with antitumor immunity. Using 78 serum samples collected from March 2020 to May 2021, participants were categorized into uninfected control (no HIV and helminth infections), HIV-infected, helminth-infected, and HIV-helminth co-infected groups. Multiplex immune regulatory molecule assay analysis was conducted. The data were analyzed using multivariate regression analysis and adjusted for confounders (age, gender, BMI, ART, supplements, and other chronic diseases). The uninfected control group was used as the baseline reference group for analysis. HIV-infected individuals had higher PD-1 (adjusted &#x3b2; = 0.12, <i>p</i> = 0.034) and TIM-3 (adjusted &#x3b2; = 23.15, <i>p</i> = 0.052) levels, with the latter showing a trend toward significance. However, lower CD28 levels (adjusted &#x3b2; = -651.95, <i>p</i> = 0.010) were observed. Helminth-infected individuals had higher TIM-3 levels (adjusted &#x3b2; = 20.98, <i>p</i> = 0.020). The co-infected group had higher PD-1 (unadjusted &#x3b2; = 0.18, <i>p</i> = 0.0046) and PD-L2 (adjusted &#x3b2; = 7.95, <i>p</i> = 0.033) levels. A significant decrease in CD28 profile was observed across all infected groups: HIV-infected (adjusted &#x3b2; = -651.95, <i>p</i> = 0.010), helminth-infected (adjusted &#x3b2; = -674.32, <i>p</i> = 0.001), and co-infected (adjusted &#x3b2; = -671.55, <i>p</i> = 0.044). The results suggest that HIV-helminth co-infections alter immune checkpoint markers, potentially increasing cancer risk by promoting an immunosuppressive microenvironment that hinders anti-cancer immunity. CD28's downregulation underscores immune inefficiency in chronic diseases. Addressing these co-infections is crucial for improving HIV care and potentially reducing cancer risks through targeted strategies.\n",

Despite this growing awareness of astrovirus presence in wild birds, limited attention has been paid to these viruses in the context of disease in Australian avifauna. Here we used unbiased RNA sequencing of intestinal samples from a galah (<i>Eolophus roseicapilla</i>) and an Australian king parrot (<i>Alisterus scapularis</i>) with a chronic diarrhoeal and wasting disease to detect the entire genomes of two novel astrovirus species. We propose naming these viruses <i>Avastrovirus eolorosei</i> (PQ893528) and <i>Avastrovirus aliscap</i> (PQ893527). The phylogenetic positions of these viruses highlight the importance of current and future metatranscriptomic virus screening in investigations of avian host landscapes beyond <i>Galloanserae</i>.

            "In recent years, the use of non-invasive host and environmental samples for the detection and monitoring of equine respiratory pathogens has shown promise and a high overall agreement with the gold standard of nasal secretions. The present study looked at comparing nose wipes, stall sponges, and air samples with nasal swabs collected from 27 horses involved in an equine influenza (EI) outbreak. The outbreak involved 5 clinical, 6 subclinical, and 16 uninfected horses. Samples sets were collected at the onset of the index case and retested every 2-3 days thereafter until all horses tested qPCR-negative for EI virus (EIV). Nose wipes and stall sponges identified EIV in all clinical cases, and air samples identified EIV in 4/5 clinical horses. The overall agreement with all nasal swabs collected from clinical cases was 89% for nose wipes, 78% for stall sponges, and 44% for air samples. Due to the shorter shedding time in subclinical cases, nose wipes and stall sponges detected EIV in 5/6 and 4/6 subclinical horses, respectively. Only one single air sample tested qPCR-positive for EIV in a subclinical shedder. When compared to the gold standard of nasal secretions in subclinically infected horses, the overall agreement was 54% for stall sponges, 50% for air samples, and 45% for nose wipes. The collection of non-invasive contact and environmental samples is a promising alternative to nasal swabs for the detection of EIV in clinically and subclinically infected horses. However, they should always be considered as a second-choice sample type to the more accurate nasal swabs and used to test refractory horses or large populations during outbreaks. Further, the pooling of identical or different samples collected from the same horse for the qPCR testing of EIV increases the accuracy of detecting EIV, especially in subclinically infected horses.\n",

            "Tilapia lake virus (TiLV) poses a major threat to global tilapia aquaculture and contributes to significant economic losses due to the absence of effective vaccines and treatments. Given the high mortality rates and severe pathological effects of TiLV on tilapia, alternative strategies, such as immunoglobulin-based therapies, are being considered for disease control. In this study, we developed specific immunoglobulin Y (IgY) antibodies against TiLV and evaluated their neutralization activity. Laying hens were immunized via intramuscular injections of recombinant TiLV segment 4 protein, and IgY antibodies were extracted and purified from their egg yolks using polyethylene glycol precipitation. Western blot analysis confirmed the specificity of the IgY, which demonstrated no cross-reactivity with nontarget proteins. Neutralization assays revealed a dose-dependent reduction in TiLV infectivity, which declined from 5.01 &#xd7; 10<sup>6</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL to 5.01 &#xd7; 10<sup>4</sup>-1.26 &#xd7; 10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL, with the highest efficacy observed at a 1:2 dilution. Despite the variability in neutralization infectivity among the different hens, IgY effectively inhibited TiLV-induced cytopathic effects. Immunofluorescence assays further confirmed a significant reduction in the TiLV antigen levels in IgY-treated RHTiB cells. Our findings highlight IgY as a promising strategy for TiLV control and suggest its potential application in the prevention of emerging viruses.\n",

            "SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants remain a global health threat, due to their capacity for rapid evolution. Variants throughout the COVID-19 pandemic exhibited variations in virulence, impacting vaccine protection and disease severity. Investigating nonstructural protein variants is critical to understanding viral evolution and manipulation of host protein interactions. We focus on nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), with multiple domains with different activities, including viral polyprotein cleavage, host deubiquitylation, de-ISGylation, and double-membrane vesicle formation. Using affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS), we identify differential protein interactions in nsp3 caused by mutations found in variants identified between 2019 and 2024: Alpha 20I, Beta 20H, Delta 21I, Delta 21J, Gamma 20J, Kappa 21B, Lambda 21G, Omicron 21K, and Omicron 21L. A small set of amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal region of nsp3 (nsp3.1) could be traced to increased interactions with RNA-binding proteins, which are vital in viral replication. Meanwhile, variants of the central region of nsp3 (nsp3.2) were found to share interactions with protein quality control machinery, including ER-associated degradation. In this construct, shared trends in interactor enrichment are observed between Omicron 21K and Delta 21I. These results underscore how minor mutations reshape host interactions, emphasizing the evolutionary arms race between the host and virus. We provide a roadmap to track the interaction changes driven by SARS-CoV-2 variant evolution.\n",

            "The implementation of easily accessible prognostic biomarkers for patients with COVID-19 remains an important area of clinical research. In this large monocentric study at a German tertiary care hospital, we determined the prognostic performance of different liver scores in 605 patients with COVID-19. We evaluated the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, the Aspartate Aminotransferase-to-Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, and the De Ritis ratio (DRR; AST/ALT ratio). The 30-day mortality was used as primary COVID-19 outcome measure. The need for intensive care unit (ICU) treatment and overall mortality were secondary endpoints. Univariable analyses showed that most of the investigated liver-related scores (FIB-4, MELD, and DRR), but not APRI for overall mortality, were significantly associated with key outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Concurrently, well-known risk factors-such as advanced age, diabetes, and cardiac or pulmonary comorbidities-were also linked to worse outcomes, except for the female sex having a preventive effect against ICU admission. A history of liver disease was rarely documented among the patients and showed no significant impact on the examined endpoints. Multivariable analyses further revealed that advanced age, DRR, and MELD were independent predictors of both 30-day and overall mortality, while FIB-4 emerged as an independent predictor specifically for overall mortality. Regarding ICU admission, obesity, underlying lung disease, and elevated APRI and MELD scores were identified as independent risk factors, whereas the female sex appeared to be protective. Overall, MELD demonstrated the strongest prognostic value for mortality and ICU admission, with DRR also exhibiting independent predictive power for mortality. These findings suggest that scores originally developed for chronic liver disease assessment-namely FIB-4, APRI, MELD, and DRR-hold promise as prognostic tools in COVID-19. In particular, MELD and DRR emerged as the most powerful biomarkers for predicting severe disease and mortality, highlighting the potential for incorporating these indices into risk stratification models for COVID-19 management. Further prospective multicenter studies are warranted to confirm these observations.\n",

            "The widespread implementation of antiretroviral therapy has significantly reduced HIV-related mortality and mother-to-child transmission. Despite being HIV-uninfected, HIV-exposed children (HEU) seem to face heightened risks of immune dysfunction, cardiometabolic diseases, growth delays, reduction in bone mineral density, and neurocognitive impairments compared to HIV-unexposed uninfected peers. These vulnerabilities can be attributed to maternal immune dysregulation during pregnancy, antiretroviral (ART) toxicity, HIV exposure, and adverse socioeconomic and nutritional environments. Emerging evidence highlights the impact of antiviral therapy exposure, particularly tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, on HEU mitochondrial dysfunction, bone resorption, neurocognitive delays, and zidovudine on cardiac abnormalities. This narrative review explores the multisystem effects of ART exposure in HEU children, focusing on immune function, neurodevelopment, cardiovascular health, growth, and bone metabolism. By synthesizing findings from diverse studies, the review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential risks associated with ART regimens and identify future research priorities to improve outcomes for HEU children.\n",

            "Oropouche virus (OROV) is a neglected and emerging arbovirus that infects humans and animals in South and Central America. OROV is primarily transmitted to humans through the bites of infected midges and possibly some mosquitoes. It is the causative agent of Oropouche fever, which has high morbidity but low mortality rates in humans. The disease manifests in humans as high fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, photophobia, and, in some cases, meningitis and encephalitis. Additionally, a recent report suggests that OROV may cause fetal death, miscarriage, and microcephaly in newborns when women are infected during pregnancy, similar to the issues caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV), another mosquito-borne disease in the same regions. OROV was first reported in the mid-20th century in the Amazon basin. Since then, over 30 epidemics and more than 500,000 infection cases have been reported. The actual case numbers may be much higher due to frequent misdiagnosis, as OROV infection presents similar clinical symptoms to other co-circulating viruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), ZIKV, and West Nile virus (WNV). Due to climate change, increased travel, and urbanization, OROV infections have occurred at an increasing pace and have spread to new regions, with the potential to reach North America. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 10,000 cases were reported in 2024, including in areas where it was not previously detected. There is an urgent need to develop vaccines, antivirals, and specific diagnostic tools for OROV diseases. However, little is known about this surging virus, and no specific treatments or vaccines are available. In this article, we review the most recent progress in understanding virology, transmission, pathogenesis, diagnosis, host-vector dynamics, and antiviral vaccine development for OROV, and provide implications for future research directions.\n",

Current methods involving immunosuppressant monitoring, the assessment of organ function, and biopsies are insufficient for predicting rejection. However, regular determination of torque teno virus (TTV) load after transplantation may prove to be a useful parameter for monitoring immunosuppression efficacy. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate TTV load in patients before and after lung transplantation and the kinetics of TTV growth in relation to immunosuppression strength. We included 14 patients (mean age: 49.4 &#xb1; 14.0 years) undergoing lung transplantation and determined TTV copy numbers using the commercial ARGENE TTV-R-GENE kit from BioMerieux from the day of transplantation to 180 days post-transplantation. We also developed an empirical immunosuppression unit scale to calculate immunosuppression strength. We observed an average positive correlation between log<sub>10</sub> TTV and immunosuppression strength, with significant increases in log<sub>10</sub> TTV depending on the duration of immunosuppression. These results indicate the potential of TTV as a new parameter to assess the possibility of transplanted organ rejection.\n",

            "The human APOBEC superfamily consists of eleven cytidine deaminase enzymes. Among them, APOBEC3 enzymes play a dual role in antiviral immunity and cancer development. APOBEC3 enzymes, including APOBEC3A (A3A) and APOBEC3B (A3B), induce mutations in viral DNA, effectively inhibiting viral replication but also promoting somatic mutations in the host genome, contributing to cancer development. A3A and A3B are linked to mutational signatures in over 50% of human cancers, with A3A being a potent mutagen. A3B, one of the first APOBEC3 enzymes linked to carcinogenesis, plays a significant role in HPV-associated cancers by driving somatic mutagenesis and tumor progression. The A3A_B deletion polymorphism results in a hybrid A3A_B gene, leading to increased A3A expression and enhanced mutagenic potential. Such polymorphism has been linked to an elevated risk of certain cancers, particularly in populations where it is more prevalent. This review explores the molecular mechanisms of APOBEC3 proteins, highlighting their dual roles in antiviral defense and tumorigenesis. We also discuss the clinical implications of genetic variants, such as the A3A_B polymorphism, mainly in HPV infection and associated cancers, providing a comprehensive understanding of their contributions to both viral restriction and cancer development.\n",

Research has explored the involvement of human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) in the pathogenesis of ALL. However, the limited characterization of its latent-phase proteins restricts a full understanding of the relationship between hCMV infection and leukemia progression. Studies have shown that hCMV induces an inflammatory response during infection, marked by the release of cytokines and chemokines. Inflammation may, therefore, play a role in how hCMV contributes to oncogenesis in pediatric ALL, possibly mediated by latent viral proteins. The classification of a virus as oncogenic is based on its alignment with cancer's established hallmarks. Viruses can manipulate host cellular mechanisms, causing dysregulated cell proliferation, evasion of apoptosis, and genomic instability. These processes lead to mutations, chromosomal abnormalities, and chronic inflammation, all of which are vital for carcinogenesis. This study aims to investigate the role of vIL-10 during the latent phase of hCMV as a potential factor in leukemia development.\n",

            "The open reading frame 103 (<i>p48</i>) of Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) is one of the 38 core baculovirus genes. <i>p48</i> has been shown to be essential for the production of infectious budded virions (BVs), nuclear egress of nucleocapsids, envelopment of the nucleocapsid, and embedding of occlusion-derived virions (ODVs) into occlusion bodies (OBs). However, the structure-function relationship of P48 remains unclear. In this study, we showed that four conserved cysteines (C127, C130, C138, and C141) in P48 may form a zinc finger motif based on a predicted structure analysis, and we investigated the roles of these cysteines in P48 function. AcMNPV bacmids lacking <i>p48</i> or containing mutated <i>p48</i> were generated. Transfection/infection assays showed that C127, C130, C138, and C141 in P48 were crucial for infectious BV production. Electron microscopy analysis further confirmed that these four cysteines played critical roles in the transport of nucleocapsids out of the nucleus for BV production, and in ODV envelopment. These results demonstrate that the conserved cysteines C127, C130, C138, and C141, related to the putative zinc finger motif, are critical for P48 function in baculovirus infection.\n",

            "In February 2024, while conducting surveillance for novel respiratory viruses, we studied four beef cattle farms near Monterrey, Mexico. Nasal swabs were collected from sick and healthy beef cattle along with 3 h aerosol samples. None of the samples had molecular evidence of influenza A viruses. Three (8%) of thirty-six nasal swabs collected from the four farms and four (33.3%) of the twelve bioaerosol specimens had molecular evidence of influenza D virus. Five sick cow nasal swabs and one bioaerosol sample on a single farm had molecular evidence of rodent coronavirus-like (RCoV), an alphacoronavirus. Three (60%) of the five RCoV-positive cattle nasal swabs also had molecular evidence of influenza D. Attempts to isolate the RCoV in Vero-E6, LLC-MK2, MDBK, and L-2 cells were unsuccessful. However, we were able to assemble ~60% of the RCoV genome using next-generation sequencing. The six RCoV-positive samples clustered with RCoV strains identified in China in 2021. During the last 12 months, we have studied an estimated 478 dairy and beef cattle nasal swabs on 11 farms in the US and Mexico, and these RCoV detections are the first we have encountered. While feed contamination cannot be ruled out, given the propensity of CoVs to jump species and that we detected RCoV only in the noses of sick cows on this one farm, we are concerned that these findings could represent an isolated RCoV spillover event. With this report, we are alerting veterinarians and cattle farm owners of our observations that RCoV may be a new cause of bovine respiratory disease.\n",

            "Hepatitis E viruses (HEV) cause hepatitis E in humans. In industrialized countries, sporadic HEV infections, typically caused by HEV genotypes 3 or 4, can become chronic and progress to liver cirrhosis in immunocompromised individuals. Pigs are a significant animal reservoir, implicating raw or undercooked pork products as potential sources of human infection. To better understand HEV dissemination in the Belgian pig population, potential risk factors were investigated by linking farm-level HEV serological status to biosecurity questionnaire data. Farrow-to-finish herd type, free-range systems, and poor boot hygiene were significantly associated with higher within-herd prevalences. This enabled an initial risk profiling of various farming types and the development of predictions for all Belgian pig farms. When combined with the census of the Belgian wild boar population, the predicted HEV status of all professional Belgian pig farms (based on these associations) does not suggest that the proximity of wild boars is a main source of HEV in free-ranging herds. Identifying risk factors for increased circulation of HEV between and within pig farms is critical to controlling its spread and reducing human infection.\n",

            "The gallid alphaherpesvirus 3 (GaAHV3) SB-1, a <i>Mardivirus</i> used as a vaccine against Marek's disease, has been proposed as an interesting viral vector for poultry vaccination. However, SB-1 is highly transmissible between chickens, a feature that may be a limitation for the use of live recombinant vaccines. We have previously shown that UL47 is essential for horizontal transmission of the pathogenic Marek's disease virus between chickens, but it is completely dispensable for replication and pathogenesis. In contrast, the role of UL47 in the biology of SB-1 remains unknown. To study that, we generated an SB-1 mutant lacking UL47 (&#x2206;47) from a commercial SB-1 isolate. This mutant replicated and spread like the WT in primary fibroblasts, indicating no growth defects in cell culture. In vivo, chickens inoculated with &#x2206;47 had significantly reduced viral loads in the blood and the spleen, and transport to the skin was delayed compared to WT inoculated chickens. Strikingly, the &#x2206;47 mutant was present in 66% of contact birds. As expected, 100% of contact birds were positive for the WT. In conclusion, our findings reveal that UL47 facilitates GaAHV3 SB-1 replication in vivo, which is important for latency establishment but is not essential for horizontal transmission, unlike for MDV.\n",

The ECSA-Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL) strain emerged in Reunion, subsequently spreading to areas such as India, the Indian Ocean, and Southeast Asia, also causing outbreaks in naive countries, including more temperate regions, which originated from infected travelers. In Italy, two authocthounous outbreaks occurred in 2007 (Emilia Romagna region) and 2017 (Lazio and Calabria regions), caused by two different ECSA-IOL strains. The phylogenetics, evolution, and phylogeography of ECSA-IOL-CHIKV strains causing the 2007 and 2017 outbreaks in Italy were investigated. The mean evolutionary rate and time-scaled phylogeny were performed through BEAST. Specific adaptive vector mutations or key signature substitutions were also investigated. The estimated mean value of the CHIKV E1 evolutionary rate was 1.313 &#xd7; 10<sup>-3</sup> substitution/site/year (95% HPD: 8.709 &#xd7; 10<sup>-4</sup>-1.827 &#xd7; 10<sup>-3</sup>).

            "TLR7 plays a key role in recognizing viral RNA to initiate an immune response. Sex-based differences in the severity of RSV respiratory infections have been noted, and this may be related to higher expression of X-linked toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) in female immune cells. Indeed, TLR7 has been shown to influence sex differences in responses to other respiratory viruses; however, its role in RSV infection remains underexplored. We infected adult C57Bl/6 or TLR7 knockout mice with RSV and compared the specific lung immune responses between different sexes. Gene expression analysis revealed that infected female mice had elevated levels of type I and II interferons, proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and viral transcripts in their lungs compared to males. Additionally, females exhibited increased numbers of macrophages and higher antibody responses in the airways. Deletion of TLR7 diminished the sex differences in certain cytokine and antibody responses. Furthermore, ex vivo infection of male alveolar macrophages with RSV resulted in greater production of proinflammatory cytokines and viral transcripts than in female macrophages, suggesting inherent sex differences in macrophage responses. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying sex differences in RSV pathophysiology and suggest that TLR7 contributes to an enhanced inflammatory response in females.\n",

            "Infection of cells with the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) triggers the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGs encode proteins with antiviral functions, such as inhibiting viral replication, promoting cell death of infected cells and enhancing immune responses. HCMV has evolved mechanisms to evade the antiviral effects of ISGs. The viral proteins encoded by the viral genes US7, US8, and US9 have been shown to interfere with interferon induction. US7 to US9 are embedded in a cluster of HCMV genes, termed US2 to US11. The individual members of this gene family interfere on multiple levels with innate and adaptive immune responses to HCMV infection. Using viral mutants with different deletions in US2 to US11, we addressed the question if genes other than US7 to US9 would also influence the IFN responses. Surprisingly, deletion of the complete US2 to US11 gene region led to reduced levels of selected ISGs. Cells infected with viruses in which individual US2 to US11 genes were deleted showed a less pronounced reduction of the selected ISGs. The experiments including RNA-seq analyses indicate that genes of the US2 to US11 gene family have a complex interaction with the IFN-ISG response which is likely regulated on the level of ISG protein stability. As US2-US11 are dispensable for replication in cell culture, the genomic region was frequently used for the insertion of bacterial artificial chromosome vectors in the process of cloning the complete HCMV genome. The results shown here must be considered when viruses derived from BACs with US2-US11 deletions are used and whether appropriate controls must be applied.\n",

In this study, we conducted an in-depth investigation into the genetic evolution of IPV from 2011 to 2024 by collecting 31 IPV variants through epidemiological surveys and public databases, including 29 variants with complete genomic sequences. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that these complete genomic sequences clustered into two distinct phylogenetic clades as follows: the Southeast Asian clade and the Chinese clade. Nucleotide and protein variation analyses demonstrated a high degree of similarity, with nucleotide identity ranging from 98.5% to 100% and protein identity from 99.4% to 100%. Further analysis of protein variations within the putative coding region identified two distinct variation patterns. The average dN/dS ratio of 0.12 highlights the strong purifying selection acting on IPV, particularly on structural proteins. In conclusion, this study significantly expands the genomic database of IPV and provides valuable insights into its genetic evolution. These findings offer critical scientific evidence to enhance detection protocols and support sustainable <i>M. rosenbergii</i> aquaculture practices.\n",

            "Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) is a viral illness caused by enterovirus infections. While the introduction of the enterovirus 71 (EV71) vaccine has significantly reduced the number of EV71-related cases, the continued spread of Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) remains a major public health threat. Previous studies have shown that human SCARB2 (hSCARB2) knock-in (KI) mice, generated using embryonic stem cell (ESC) technology, are susceptible to CVA16. However, these models have failed to reproduce the clinical pathology and neurotoxicity after CVA16 infection. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a more reliable and effective animal model to study CVA16. In this study, we successfully created a hSCARB2 KI mouse model targeting the ROSA26 locus using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology. The application of CRISPR/Cas9 enabled stable and widespread expression of hSCARB2 in the model. After infection, the KI mice exhibited a clinical pathology that closely mimics human infection, with prominent limb weakness and paralysis. The virus was detectable in multiple major organs of the mice, with peak viral load observed on day 7 post-infection, gradually clearing thereafter. Further analysis revealed widespread neuronal necrosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the brain and spinal cord of the KI mice. Additionally, significant activation of astrocytes (GFAP-positive) and microglia (IBA1-positive) was observed in the brain, suggesting that CVA16 infection may induce limb paralysis by attacking neuronal cells. Overall, this model effectively replicates the neuropathological changes induced by CVA16 infection and provides a potential experimental platform for studying CVA16-associated pathogenesis and neurotoxicity.\n",

In this study, potential mechanisms behind this exhaustion were investigated. First, the viral load of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human adenovirus (HAdV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was determined in sputum samples (n = 29) derived from ME/CFS patients (n = 13), healthy controls (n = 10), elderly healthy controls (n = 4), and immunosuppressed controls (n = 2). Secondly, autoantibodies (autoAbs) to type I interferon (IFN-I) in sputum were analyzed to possibly explain impaired viral immunity. We found that ME/CFS patients released EBV at a significantly higher level compared to controls (<i>p</i> = 0.0256). HHV6 was present in ~50% of all participants at the same level. HAdV was detected in two cases with immunosuppression and severe ME/CFS, respectively. HCMV and SARS-CoV-2 were found only in immunosuppressed controls. Notably, anti-IFN-I autoAbs in ME/CFS and controls did not differ, except in a severe ME/CFS case showing an increased level. We conclude that ME/CFS patients, compared to controls, have a significantly higher load of EBV. IFN-I autoAbs cannot explain IFN-I dysfunction, with the possible exception of severe cases, also reported in severe SARS-CoV-2. We forward that additional mechanisms, such as the viral evasion of IFN-I effect via the degradation of IFN-receptors, may be present in ME/CFS, which demands further studies.\n",

It is pivotal in providing crucial insights into the three-dimensional frame of viruses and viral proteins at atomic-level or near-atomic-level resolution. Structure-based assessment of viral components, including capsids, envelope proteins, replication machinery, and host interaction interfaces, is instrumental in unraveling the multiplex mechanisms of viral infection, replication, and pathogenesis. The structural elucidation of viral enzymes, including proteases, polymerases, and integrases, has been essential in combating viruses like HIV-1 and HIV-2, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza. Techniques including X-ray crystallography, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy, Cryo-electron Microscopy, and Cryo-electron Tomography have revolutionized the field of virology and significantly aided in the discovery of antiviral therapeutics. The ubiquity of chronic viral infections, along with the emergence and reemergence of new viral threats necessitate the development of novel antiviral strategies and agents, while the extensive structural diversity of viruses and their high mutation rates further underscore the critical need for structural analysis of viral proteins to aid antiviral development. This review highlights the significance of structure-based investigations for bridging the gap between structure and function, thus facilitating the development of effective antiviral therapeutics, vaccines, and antibodies for tackling emerging viral threats.\n",

Herein, we report the development of a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay incorporating xylenol orange (XO) as a visual indicator for FCoV detection. The assay employed six oligonucleotide primers targeting regions of the nucleocapsid (N) gene. Under optimized conditions (65 &#xb0;C, 60 min), amplification products were detected through pH-dependent colour changes in the XO dye. The RT-LAMP-XO assay exhibited high specificity for FCoV, with no cross-reactivity against other common feline viral pathogens. While the detection limit (1.7 &#xd7; 10<sup>1</sup> copies/&#xb5;L) was an order of magnitude higher than that of qPCR, the method offered advantages in simplicity and speed compared to existing diagnostic approaches. Although less sensitive than qPCR, the RT-LAMP-XO assay may serve as a rapid screening tool when used in combination with additional primer sets. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of XO-based RT-LAMP as a simple, visual detection method for FCoV infection.\n",

Phylogenetic analysis of these viruses indicated a common origin, which led us to hypothesize indirect transmission of these viruses between the two flocks. Since, to our knowledge, there are no published data on the tenacity of these viruses, we started this work. In the first part, we monitored the loss of infectivity of two prototypic SRLV strains, MVV 1514 and CAEV-CO, over time, in liquid suspension. As expected, the suspensions stored at 4 &#xb0;C better preserved the infectivity of the viruses. Additionally, viruses resuspended in milk, the medium mirroring the in vivo situation, proved more tenacious than those maintained in a cell culture medium. These viruses, subjected to harsh treatments such as drying and resuspending, partially maintained their replication capacity. After an immediate loss of nearly 1 log<sub>10</sub> TCID<sub>50</sub> immediately after desiccation, the viruses maintained their replication capacity for at least three weeks when desiccated in milk. These results suggest that fomites, clothing, or pastures contaminated with secretions or milk from infected animals might mediate the infection of animals independently of direct contact.\n",

The study presented herein describes the preparative synthesis, formulation, and evaluation of LO both in vitro and in vivo for its antiviral activity against human herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) as a model of viral infection. Evaluation of cytotoxicity using A549 cells indicated that a combination of LO (400 &#x3bc;M) and LCA (30 &#x3bc;M) exhibited a favorable safety profile while effectively inhibiting HSV-1 infection comparable to acyclovir treatment. Furthermore, in the in vivo assay, animals treated with an oily formulation containing 7% LO; 0.50% LCA; and 3% oleic acid (OA), 48 h prior to virus exposure, showed results even superior to a 5% acyclovir commercial formulation in terms of scar formation and wound recovery.

Molecular genetic methods allow for arriving at an accurate diagnosis, employing timely preventive measures, and controlling the spread of the disease-causing agent. In this study, whole-genome sequencing of three SARS-CoV-2 strains was performed using the Sanger method, which provides high accuracy in determining nucleotide sequences and avoids errors associated with multiple DNA amplification. Complete nucleotide sequences of samples, KAZ/Britain/2021, KAZ/B1.1/2021, and KAZ/Delta020/2021 were obtained, with sizes of 29.751 bp, 29.815 bp, and 29.840 bp, respectively. According to the COVID-19 Genome Annotator, 127 mutations were detected in the studied samples compared to the reference strain. The strain KAZ/Britain/2021 contained 3 deletions, 7 synonymous mutations, and 27 non-synonymous mutations, the second strain KAZ/B1.1/2021 contained 1 deletion, 5 synonymous mutations, and 31 non-synonymous mutations, and the third strain KAZ/Delta020/2021 contained 1 deletion, 5 synonymous mutations, and 37 non-synonymous mutations, respectively. The variations C241T, F106F, P314L, and D614G found in the 5' UTR, <i>ORF1ab</i>, and <i>S</i> regions were common to all three studied samples, respectively.

One hundred and forty freeze-thawed samples (70 that were RT-PCR-positive and 70 that were RT-PCR-negative on original tests) submitted to the diagnostic laboratory over a seven-year period were tested in addition to 123 fresh samples (15 RT-PCR-positive and 108 RT-PCR-negative) submitted over a four- month period in 2024. The analyst performing the RAD tests was blinded to the RT-PCR result as were the two individuals who read the results. Samples with discordant results were re-tested in duplicate using RT-PCR and the two RAD kits. Both kits demonstrated a high level of concordance with the RT-PCR (&gt;95%). However, testing of serial dilutions of RT-PCR positive faeces samples indicated that the RADs failed to detect the virus at the higher dilutions. In conclusion, the RADs evaluated are potentially useful for screening individual foals and for the determination of the urgency of the appropriate treatment and isolation. Negative samples from suspect cases and weak positives should always be submitted to a specialist laboratory for real-time RT-PCR testing.\n",

During the 2022-2023 spring and autumn seasons, 1386 rodents were trapped, including 73 <i>Rattus norvegicus</i> carrying Seoul virus (SEOV). The highest detection rate was observed in the liver (3.84%), followed by the kidneys (3.46%) and lungs (3.09%). Viral load analysis revealed higher SEOV RNA levels in the liver than in the lungs and kidneys. Antibody levels in <i>R. norvegicus</i> may influence the detection of viruses in organs. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that all sequences belonged to the S3 subtype, exhibiting regional aggregation and genetic stability. Our findings emphasize the necessity of multi-organ sampling for comprehensive HV surveillance and epidemic risk assessment.\n",

            "Salivary human herpesvirus 6 and/or 7 (HHV-6/7) have recently attracted attention as microbiological markers of physiological fatigue in laborers and athletes. However, the accuracy and efficiency of the HHV-6/7 assays can be improved for practical application. We conducted three experiments to identify suitable saliva collection and DNA extraction methods for practical salivary HHV-6/7 assays. The main experiment compared the data, including template DNA or HHV-6/7 concentrations, among three saliva collection methods (cotton, synthetic, and no swabs) and two DNA extraction methods (magnetic bead-based and silica column-based). It showed that using swabs had adverse effects: lower template DNA concentration, lower HHV-6/7 detection rates, higher coefficient of variation values, and lower concentrations. Moreover, magnetic bead-based methods resulted in higher HHV-6/7 detection rates and lower coefficient of variation values. Sub-experiment 1 examined practical saliva collection methods and demonstrated that the stimulated spitting method could collect saliva in a shorter time with lower subjective stress than the unstimulated spitting and stimulated swabbing methods. Sub-experiment 2 investigated diurnal variation in salivary HHV-6/7 levels but did not show diurnal variation. These findings suggest that (1) the combination of stimulated spitting saliva collection and magnetic bead-based DNA extraction is most suitable for practical salivary HHV-6/7 assays, and (2) saliva collection can be conducted whenever needed.\n",

            "<i>Rotavirus alphagastroenteritidis</i> is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide in young humans and animals. In 2023-2024, a relatively high rotavirus detection rate (34.5%) was detected in children with diarrhea in Caracas. All rotavirus strains were typed as P[8], using a multiplex RT-PCR assay, while the G-type was not identified. This unusual pattern, not previously observed in Venezuela, prompted the VP7 gene sequencing of nineteen strains, which displayed a high sequence identity (99.3-100%) compatible with the G3 genotype. These strains clustered into a well-supported lineage IX encompassing human reassortants of equine-like G3P[8] strains described elsewhere, showing a very close genetic relationship (99.0-99.9%). Old G3 rotavirus isolates obtained from diarrheic samples in the past were included in the analysis and grouped into lineage I together with ancestral reference G3 strains. The novel G3P[8]s carry amino acid changes in VP7-neutralizing epitopes, compared with the RotaTeq-WI78-8-vaccine strain. Full genome sequencing of a representative strain revealed a genotype constellation including an equine-like G3P[8] in a DS-1-like backbone (I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2), confirming the role of animal strains as a source of diversification, and the importance of unceasingly revising molecular typing strategies and vaccine efficacy to guarantee their success.\n",

            "Bovine ephemeral fever is an arthropod-borne viral disease that affects cattle and buffalo in many regions of the world; it causes heavy economic losses in the cattle industry. To date, all BEFV-specific diagnostic molecular assays have been based on the variable glycoprotein (G-protein)-coding genome region, potentially allowing the pathogen to escape detection. We developed two new assays, based on the less variable nucleoprotein genome region, and compared them with two G-protein-based assays. For this comparison, we used 245 samples comprising positive and negative field samples from Israeli outbreaks caused by different strains, belonging to lineage I and IIIa, as well as Australian and Japanese strains (lineages IV and IIIb). The new assays showed high agreement with the previous assay (Kappa = 0.92), detecting 144 out of 147 positive samples (sensitivity of 97.96%), and detected 6 more samples as positive out of 98 samples found negative by the G-protein-based assay. All nine non-agreeing results were validated as positive using a conventional RT-PCR assay. The new assays have higher analytical sensitivity than the previous assays, can be combined with internal controls, and enable the detection of all known BEFVs. The results indicate that these two nucleoprotein-based real-time RT-qPCRs can serve as fast, sensitive, and specific assays for the sustainable detection of BEFV strains.\n",

This study provides a genomic, phylogenetic, and ecological analysis of neglected Orthobunyaviruses using next-generation sequencing and computational predictions. We identified unique phylogenetic relationships, with Tanga virus forming a distinct lineage linked to zoonotic, human-associated, or non-vertebrate viruses across segments. GC content analysis revealed segment-specific patterns: higher GC content in the S segment suggests genomic stability and immune evasion, while lower GC content in the L segment reflects host-vector adaptation. Phylogenetic ties to well-characterized pathogenic viruses, such as Ilesha virus with Cache Valley virus and Bwamba virus with California encephalitis virus, indicate potential neurotropism. Ingwavuma virus clustered with Oropouche virus, suggesting risks of systemic febrile illnesses. Within the Simbu serogroup, Sango and Sabo viruses show teratogenic risks to livestock. Vector and host predictions implicate rodents, artiodactyls, and primates in Orthobunyavirus transmission, emphasizing complex ecological dynamics and zoonotic potential. These findings advance the understanding of Orthobunyavirus diversity, linking genomic features to pathogenicity and ecological adaptation, while providing a foundation for future surveillance and intervention strategies targeting these neglected viruses.\n",

BKPyV is primarily associated with hemorrhagic cystitis (HC), while JCPyV causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The pathogenesis of these diseases involves viral reactivation under immunosuppressive conditions, leading to replication in tissues such as the kidney, bladder, and central nervous system. BKPyV-HC presents as hematuria and urinary symptoms, graded by severity. PML, though rare after allo-HSCT, manifests as neurological deficits due to JCPyV replication in glial cells. Diagnosis relies on nucleic acid amplification testing for DNAuria or DNAemia as well as clinical criteria. Management primarily involves supportive care, as no antiviral treatments have proven consistently effective for either virus and need further research. This review highlights the virology, clinical presentations, and management challenges of PyV-associated diseases post-allo-HSCT, emphasizing the need for improved diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches to mitigate morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population.\n",

            "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) presents a substantial challenge to the global swine industry. However, the origin, host range, and potential cross-species transmission of PEDV remain poorly understood. This study characterizes a novel PEDV strain, CHFJFQ, isolated from diarrheic piglets in Fuqing, Fujian, China. Through sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, we determined that CHFJFQ belongs to the GIIa subgroup and is a recombinant with CH/HNXX/2016 as the major parent and NW17 as the minor parent. Compared to CV777, CHFJFQ exhibits multiple base deletions and insertions across the 5'UTR, ORF1a/b, S, and ORF3 genes. Phylogenetic analysis indicates shared ancestry with bat coronaviruses, though a direct zoonotic origin remains uncertain. Interestingly, CHFJFQ demonstrated its ability to infect human and mouse cell lines in vitro and, more significantly, caused in vivo infection in both pigs and mice. The primary target organs were the intestines, lungs, and spleen, resulting in 100% mortality in suckling piglets. PEDV CHFJFQ was detected in mouse tissues, but no clinical signs were observed, indicating limited cross-species pathogenicity. Overall, these findings offer crucial insights into the epidemiology, genetics, infectivity, and pathogenicity of PEDV and provide valuable information for vaccine development.\n",

            "<i>Cotton leaf curl Kokhran virus</i>-Burewala (CLCuKoV-Bur) has a circular single-stranded ssDNA genome of 2759 nucleotides in length and belongs to the genus <i>Begomovirus</i> (family, <i>Geminiviridae</i>). CLCuKoV-Bur causes cotton leaf curl disease (CLCuD) and is transmitted by the whitefly <i>Bemisis tabaci</i> cryptic species. Monopartite begomoviruses encode five open reading frames (ORFs). CLCuKoV-Bur replicates through a dsDNA intermediate. Five open reading frames (ORFs) are organized in the small circular, single-stranded (ss)-DNA genome of CLCuKoV-Bur (2759 bases). RNA interference (RNAi) is a naturally occurring process that has revolutionized the targeting of gene regulation in eukaryotic organisms to combat virus infection. The aim of this study was to elucidate the potential binding attractions of cotton-genome-encoded microRNAs (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>-microRNAs, ghr-miRNAs) on CLCuKoV-Bur ssDNA-encoded mRNAs using online bioinformatics target prediction tools, RNA22, psRNATarget, RNAhybrid, and TAPIR. Using this suite of robust algorithms, the predicted repertoire of the cotton microRNA-binding landscape was determined for a CLCuKoV-Bur consensus genome sequence. Previously experimentally validated cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> L.) miRNAs (<i>n</i> = 80) were selected from a public repository miRNA registry miRBase (v22) and hybridized in silico into the CLCuKoV-Bur genome (AM421522) coding and non-coding sequences. Of the 80 ghr-miRNAs interrogated, 18 ghr-miRNAs were identified by two to four algorithms evaluated. Among them, the ghr-miR399d (accession no. MIMAT0014350), located at coordinate 1747 in the CLCuKoV-Bur genome, was predicted by a consensus or \"union\" of all four algorithms and represents an optimal target for designing an artificial microRNA (amiRNA) silencing construct for in planta expression. Based on all robust predictions, an in silico ghr-miRNA-regulatory network was developed for CLCuKoV-Bur ORFs using Circos software version 0.6. These results represent the first predictions of ghr-miRNAs with the therapeutic potential for developing CLCuD resistance in upland cotton plants.\n",

            "The \"Kick and Kill\" strategy, which aims to reactivate latent HIV reservoirs and facilitate the clearance of reactivated HIV-infected cells, has yet to achieve a functional cure due to the limited efficacy of current latency reversal agents. This study evaluates the combination efficacy of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor in latency reversal and immune-mediated clearance. Latently infected J-Lat cells and dual-fluorescent HIV-infected primary CD4 T cells were treated with the HDAC inhibitor (vorinostat) and one of four PARP inhibitors (olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib, or talazoparib). PARP inhibitors, when administered alone, showed no latency reversal activity. However, when combined with vorinostat, their efficacy increased threefold compared to vorinostat alone. This effect was mediated by the inhibition of tankyrase, a PARP superfamily member, which modulates the Hippo signaling pathway. In HIV<sub>GR670</sub>-infected primary cells, the combination reduced the reservoir size by 67%. In addition, talazoparib alone significantly reduced actively infected cells by 50%. Talazoparib-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells co-cultured with K562 cells demonstrated enhanced NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, with a 10% reduction in K562 cell viability. These findings demonstrate that combining HDAC and PARP inhibitors augments latency reversal and reservoir reduction. With both the HDAC inhibitors and PARP inhibitors used in this study approved by the FDA for cancer treatment, this combination therapy holds strong potential for rapid clinical integration, contingent upon the confirmation of efficacy and safety in ongoing in vivo studies.\n",

            "Cardiac glycosides (CGs), historically used to treat heart failure and arrhythmias, bind to the &#x3b1; subunit of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump and inhibit its activity. Their anticancer and antiviral activities are of interest. The &#x3b1; subunit of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump has four isoforms (&#x3b1;1-4), each with unique tissue distribution and expression pattern; their contributions to antiviral activities have not been studied. We previously reported that CGs inhibit human CMV (HCMV) in vitro but not mouse CMV (MCMV). In addition to the low affinity of mouse &#x3b1;1 for CGs, we hypothesized that other isoforms contribute to the anti-CMV activities of CGs. We show here that infection with HCMV significantly induced &#x3b1;3 in human foreskin fibroblasts, while MCMV did not induce mouse &#x3b1;3. Infection with guinea pig CMV (GPCMV) in GP fibroblasts also induced &#x3b1;3, and CGs inhibited GPCMV replication. HCMV inhibition with digitoxin reduced &#x3b1;3 expression. The concentration-dependent inhibition of HCMV with digitoxin analogs also correlated with &#x3b1;3 expression. Intriguingly, &#x3b1;3 was localized to the nucleus, and changes in its expression during infection and digitoxin treatment were mostly limited to the nucleus. At 4 h post-infection, &#x3b1;3 colocalized with immediate early 1 (IE1) and the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). An interaction of &#x3b1;3-PML-IE1 at 24 h post-infection was disrupted by digitoxin. The mRNA levels of IE1, major immediate early promoter (MIEP)-derived IE, and antiviral cytokines were reduced in infected digitoxin-treated cells. Summarized, these findings suggest a new role for &#x3b1;3 in the anti-HCMV activities of CGs via nuclear antiviral signaling pathways.\n",

This year, an OROV outbreak was identified in Brazil, and its vertical transmission was reported, which was associated with fetal death and microcephaly. We describe the clinical manifestations identified in three cases of congenital OROV infection with confirmed serology (OROV-IgM) in the mother-newborn binomial. One of the newborns died, and post-mortem molecular analysis using real-time RT-qPCR identified the OROV genome in several tissues. All three newborns were born in the Amazon region in Brazil, and the mothers reported fever, rash, headache, myalgia, and/or retro-orbital pain during pregnancy. The newborns presented with severe microcephaly secondary to brain damage and arthrogryposis, suggestive of an embryo/fetal disruptive process at birth. Brain and spinal images identified overlapping sutures, cerebral atrophy, brain cysts, thinning of the spinal cord, corpus callosum, and posterior fossa abnormalities. Fundoscopic findings included macular chorioretinal scars, focal pigment mottling, and vascular attenuation. The clinical presentation of vertical OROV infection resembled congenital Zika syndrome to some extent but presents some distinctive features on brain imaging and in several aspects of its neurological presentation. A recognizable syndrome with severe brain damage, neurological alterations, arthrogryposis, and fundoscopic abnormalities can be associated with in utero OROV infection.\n",

Therefore, a detailed knowledge of local aphids, identification of viruliferous species, and the development of new monitoring tools are necessary to improve CTV control strategies. Herein, a 2-year survey was conducted to assess the frequency of aphid species infesting several citrus pilot orchards. Plot findings based on morphological and molecular identification revealed <i>Aphis spiraecola</i> (ranged from 44-100%) as the most abundant aphid species, followed by <i>A. gossypii</i> (&lt;50%). <i>Toxoptera aurantii, Myzus persicae</i>, and <i>A. craccivora</i> were present in low numbers, and <i>A. citricidus</i> was not detected. Due to the absence of CTV detection in aphids and citrus trees from the pilot orchards, a complementary survey was conducted in CTV-infected fields. Three aphid species were identified as CTV-positive by RT-PCR, suggesting that they may be viruliferous, with <i>A. spiraecola</i> as predominant, followed by <i>A. gossypii</i> and <i>T. aurantii</i>. Additionally, we developed a non-invasive procedure for identifying aphid species using wingbeat analysis. This method provides a faster alternative to traditional identification techniques by taxonomic keys based on morphological features or PCR, although its accuracy is lower (approximately 95% for the two species tested). Overall, this work provides a detailed study of aphid species composition in citrus orchards, identifies the predominant local putative CTV vector, and introduces a novel sensor for aphid monitoring, contributing to improved epidemic forecasting and sustainable disease management strategies.\n",

            "The evolutionary arms race between host restriction factors and viral antagonists provides crucial insights into immune system evolution and viral adaptation. This study investigates the structural and evolutionary dynamics of the double-domain restriction factors A3F and A3G and their viral inhibitor, Vif, across diverse primate species. By constructing 3D structural homology models and integrating ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR), we identified patterns of sequence diversity, structural conservation, and functional adaptation. Inactive CD1 (Catalytic Domain 1) domains displayed greater sequence diversity and more positive surface charges than active CD2 domains, aiding nucleotide chain binding and intersegmental transfer. Despite variability, the CD2 DNA-binding grooves remained structurally consistent with conserved residues maintaining critical functions. A3F and A3G diverged in loop 7' interaction strategies, utilising distinct molecular interactions to facilitate their roles. Vif exhibited charge variation linked to host species, reflecting its coevolution with A3 proteins. These findings illuminate how structural adaptations and charge dynamics enable both restriction factors and their viral antagonists to adapt to selective pressures. Our results emphasize the importance of studying structural evolution in host-virus interactions, with implications for understanding immune defense mechanisms, zoonotic risks, and viral evolution. This work establishes a foundation for further exploration of restriction factor diversity and coevolution across species.\n",

Therefore, the development of an effective HSV-1 vaccine is crucial. In this study, we focused on an HSV-1 mutant strain, M6, which includes several deleted genes associated with viral infection virulence and latent infection function, and explored its infection of macrophages and immunological characteristics. The study found that both the attenuated strain M6 and the wild-type strain infect macrophages through the binding of the gD protein to the HVEM receptor on the macrophage surface. Compared to the wild-type strain, the attenuated M6 strain induced a milder immune response, characterized by the lower expression of immune signaling molecules and inflammatory cytokine levels. Upon reintroducing macrophages infected with the two strains into mice, the M6 strain induced lower levels of inflammatory cytokines and higher levels of chemokines in spleen cells and also slightly lower humoral and cellular immune responses than the wild-type strain. Further histopathological analysis revealed that mice in the attenuated M6 group showed more stable body weight changes and milder pathological damage in immune organs such as the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. In conclusion, the attenuated M6 strain exhibits good immunogenicity and mild pathological side effects, suggesting its potential as an effective immunogen.\n",

            "Chronic viral infections like HIV, HBV, and HCV establish persistent interactions with the host immune system, resulting in immune evasion and long-term immune dysfunction. These viruses use a range of strategies to limit host defenses, such as downregulating MHC class I, disrupting interferon signaling, altering apoptosis pathways, and suppressing cytotoxic T-cell activity. Key viral proteins, including HIV Nef, HBV X protein, and HCV NS5A, interfere with antigen presentation and JAK/STAT signaling, thereby reducing antiviral immune responses. Chronic infections induce immune exhaustion due to persistent antigen exposure, which leads to the expression of inhibitory receptors like PD-1 and CTLA-4 on T cells. Viral epigenetic changes, such as N6-methyladenosine modifications and histone deacetylation, enhance immune evasion by modulating gene expression in infected cells. Viruses further manipulate host cytokine networks by promoting an immunosuppressive environment through IL-10 and TGF-&#x3b2; secretion, which suppress inflammatory responses and inhibit T-cell activation. This review examines the molecular/cellular mechanisms that enable chronic viruses to escape host immunity, focusing on antigenic variation, cytokine disruption, and control of apoptotic pathways. It also addresses how host genetic factors, such as HLA polymorphisms, influence disease progression. Lastly, we discuss host-targeted therapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, cytokine treatments, and CRISPR.\n",

            "In recent years, the incidence of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) has increased due to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. However, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic extends beyond mortality rates. Recent analyses suggest that the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2 have significantly affected the epidemiology of other key respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus (FLUV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus (RV). These changes raise new questions about the dynamics and incidence of post-COVID-19 respiratory infections, as well as potential alterations in symptom profiles and clinical outcomes. In this study, we analyzed data from the Epidemiological Surveillance Information System of Respiratory Viral Agents (SIVEP-Gripe), established by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, to examine the profile of SARI before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. Our data reveal a distinct epidemiological pattern, with a significant decrease in FLUV notifications during the pandemic, accompanied by peaks in RSV and RV cases in late 2020. Additionally, there was a shift in the age distribution of RSV and other viral infections, with individuals infected during the pandemic being older than those infected before the pandemic. Interestingly, the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Bahia State resulted in a reduction in the frequency of symptoms associated with non-SARS-CoV-2 SARI, without altering clinical outcomes. Our findings suggest that the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has contributed to a clinical and epidemiological shift, particularly for FLUV, RSV, and other viruses, marked by a reduction in symptoms such as fever, dyspnea, respiratory distress, and the need for ventilatory support. The underlying mechanisms driving these changes remain unclear. These insights are crucial for public health authorities and policymakers to refine surveillance strategies and enhance control measures for respiratory viruses, particularly those causing SARI.\n",

            "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne zoonotic viral disease prevalent in Africa. While infection is asymptomatic in animals, it can cause severe illness with hemorrhagic manifestations and high mortality rates in humans. This study aimed to determine the seroprevalence and potential risk factors of CCHF in wild (rodents, birds) and domestic (cattle, horses) animals in Benin. A cross-sectional study was carried out from 2022 to 2024 with the assistance of cattle breeders, hunters, farmers and bushmeat sellers in 15 districts found in three agroecological zones in the country. A total of 366 serum samples were analyzed, comprising 254 collected from wild animals and 112 from domestic animals. Among the wild animals tested, 1.18% (95% CI: 0.31-3.70; n = 3) were seropositive for antibodies against CCHF virus (CCHFV). The seroprevalence rates were 3.7% (95% CI: 0.19-20.89) in squirrels, 5.88% (95% CI: 0.31-30.76) in hares and 1.19% (95% CI: 0.06-7.38) in giant rats. In domestic animals, anti-CCHFV antibodies were detected in 38 of the 112 samples, resulting in an overall seroprevalence of 33.93% (95% CI: 25.42-43.56). Specifically, antibodies were identified in 34 out of 81 cattle (41.98%, 95% CI: 31.26-53.46) and 4 out of 24 horses (16.67%, 95% CI: 5.48-38.19). No positive samples were reported in pigeons. This study provides the first seroprevalence data on CCHF in wild and domestic animals in Benin. It highlights the risk and epidemiological dynamics of the disease and underscores the need for further investigations into tick vectors and human populations.\n",

            "In the history of yellow fever (YF) outbreaks in Brazil, howler monkeys (<i>Alouatta</i> sp.) and marmosets (<i>Callithrix</i> sp.) have been among the most affected genera, exhibiting significant hepatic injuries similar to those seen in humans. However, limited information exists regarding yellow fever virus (YFV) infection in their central nervous system (CNS). To address this gap, an epidemiological study was conducted to assess tissue changes, viral detection, and cytokine profiles in the brains of both neotropical primate species when they are naturally infected with YFV. A total of 22 brain samples from these species (8 from <i>Alouatta</i> sp. and 14 from <i>Callithrix</i> sp.) showing infection with YFV in the liver via immunohistochemistry (IHC) were selected. From them, YFV antigen detection occurred in 35.7% (5/14) of <i>Callithrix</i> sp. brain samples and 87.5% (7/8) of <i>Alouatta</i> sp. samples, with a higher frequency of viral antigen quantification in <i>Callithrix</i> sp. Both species exhibited similar CNS lesions, characterized by congestion, low hemorrhage, limited inflammatory infiltration interstitial and perivascular edema associated with neuronal degeneration, neurophagy, and higher cell death (necrosis and apoptosis) quantification. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine profiles were balanced, with TNF-&#x3b1; and IL-1&#x3b2; playing a key role in inflammation, while IL-10 and IL-13 exhibited a prominent role in immunomodulation, suggesting an anti-inflammatory modulation typical of flaviviruses occurs. This study demonstrates that YFV can induce CNS lesions in neotropical primates, establishing it as a secondary target of viral tropism. These findings highlight the importance of collecting nervous tissue during epizootics, particularly in <i>Callithrix</i> sp., as such tissue is often overlooked despite its critical role in disease monitoring.\n",

            "The pandemic threat from newly emerging viral diseases constitutes a major unsolved issue for global health. Antiviral therapy can play an important role in treating and preventing the spread of unprecedented viral infections. A repository of compounds exhibiting broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a series of different viral families would be an invaluable asset to be prepared for future pandemic threats. Utilizing an open innovation crowd-sourcing paradigm, we were able to identify a compound class of diphenylureas that exhibits in vitro antiviral activity against multiple viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), adenovirus, dengue virus, herpes, and influenza viruses. Compound 4 among the series exhibits strong activity against dengue virus, a growing global health problem with high medical need and no approved antiviral drug. The compounds are active against SARS-CoV-2 in a primary human stem cell-based mucociliary airway epithelium model and also active in vivo, as shown in a murine SARS-CoV-2 infection model. These results demonstrate the potential of the chemical class as antivirals on the one hand and the power of open innovation, crowd-sourcing, and repurposing on the other hand.\n",

            "<i>Passiflora edulis</i>, introduced to the Republic of Korea in 1989 and commercially cultivated since 2012, has faced recent challenges due to viral infections impacting growth, yield, and quality. This study aimed to investigate the viral infections in <i>P. edulis</i> and surrounding weeds at cultivation sites in the Republic of Korea, examining possible correlations between the infections for sustainable agriculture. Over five years, <i>P. edulis</i> and weed samples were collected for virus diagnosis using PCR and RT-PCR assays, analyzing the infection status in both <i>P. edulis</i> and weeds and across weed species/families. The findings revealed infections with EuLCV, PaLCuGdV, CMV, and EAPV in both <i>P. edulis</i> and weeds, with PaLCuGdV showing the highest infection rate. Although no direct correlation was found between the presence of the same viruses in <i>P. edulis</i> and weeds, suggesting that there may be interactions among different viruses, the study highlighted that EuLCV infection could exacerbate symptoms when coinfected by other viruses. The study underscores the importance of implementing preventive measures within greenhouses to control virus transmission, offering insights for strategic management of viral diseases in <i>P. edulis</i> cultivation. These findings support the sustainable production of agricultural products by providing actionable strategies, such as the removal of weeds to eliminate habitats for vectors like whiteflies and aphids and the targeted management of high-incidence weeds from the Asteraceae, Solanaceae, and Oxalidaceae families to prevent and control the spread of EuLCV.\n",

This study highlights the epidemiology and emerging trends of key zoonotic viruses associated with pigs, emphasizing their role in endemic and emerging disease dynamics. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) persists as a major concern, with pigs acting as amplifying host, while hepatitis E virus (HEV) remains a prominent cause of viral hepatitis, transmitted via contaminated water and pork products. Emerging high-fatality viral zoonoses caused by Nipah virus (NiV) and recurrent threats from swine influenza virus (SIV) demonstrate that the zoonotic landscape is evolving. Furthermore, zoonotic viruses like rotavirus, pseudorabies (ADV or SuHV-1), porcine astrovirus (PAstV), and Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) reflect the expanding diversity of pig-associated pathogens in India. Emerging evidence also implicates viruses such as Chandipura virus (CHPV) in localized outbreaks, indicating broader zoonotic potential. Novel risks such as swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 emphasize the role of pigs as potential intermediaries for pandemic-prone viruses. This comprehensive study evaluates the prevalence, outbreak dynamics, and public health implications of zoonotic viral diseases of pigs in India, providing valuable direction for developing effective control measures.\n",

Human bronchial epithelial cells serve as a viral replication target and source of the innate immune response to these viruses. To better understand the immune responses induced by RSV and HMPV in the pediatric airway epithelium, we comparatively studied pediatric and adult epithelial responses. We used normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells cultured in an air-liquid interface culture system (ALI), which helps to mimic the architecture of the human lower respiratory tract epithelium. Our results demonstrate differential viral replication patterns and reduced interferons; and inflammatory cytokines' expression in pediatric cells compared to adult cells. However, pediatric epithelial cells expressed an increased mucus response and induced a stronger pro-inflammatory response in monocyte-derived dendritic cells. These findings reveal age-dependent immune epithelial responses that may contribute to more severe infections by HMPV and RSV.\n",

            "The porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) possesses an inherent ability to adapt to environmental transformations and undergo evolutionary changes, which has imposed significant economic pressure on the global pig industry. Given the potential for recombination among PRRSV genomes and variations in pathogenicity, newly emerging PRRSV isolates are of considerable clinical importance. In this study, we successfully isolated a novel strain named XJ-Z5 from PRRSV-positive samples collected in Xinjiang province in 2022. Through comprehensive genomic sequencing, phylogenetic analysis, and recombination analysis, we confirmed that this strain belongs to the NADC30-like recombinant PRRSV. During pathogenicity tests in piglets, this strain exhibited moderate virulence, causing symptoms such as reduced appetite, persistent fever, and weight loss; however, no mortality cases were observed. Tests conducted at various time points detected the presence of PRRSV nucleic acid in nasal swabs, rectal swabs, tissue samples, and blood, with the highest viral loads found in lung tissue and blood. Serum biochemical tests indicated significant impairment of liver and kidney function. PRRSV antibodies began to appear gradually after 10 days post infection. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed substantial pathological changes in lung tissue and lymph nodes. This study enhances our understanding of the epidemiology of PRRSV and underscores the importance of ongoing monitoring and research in light of the challenges posed by the continuous evolution of viral strains. Furthermore, the research emphasizes the urgency of the rapid genomic analysis of emerging viral strains. Through these comprehensive research and monitoring strategies, we aimed to curb the spread of PRRSV more effectively and thus reduce the huge economic losses it caused to the pig industry.\n",

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG among newcomer students at Kafr Elsheikh University in Egypt, whether they had been vaccinated or not. Blood samples from 400 healthy newcomer students (200 non-vaccinated and 200 vaccinated) were evaluated for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG using colloidal gold immunochromatography lateral flow immunoassay cards, and then the results were confirmed by using specific ELISA tests. The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among the participants (<i>n</i> = 400) was 56.3% for IgG and 13.3% for IgM. Regarding the non-vaccinated participants, 55.0% were females, the mean age was 18.2 years, and the mean BMI was 25.35. Regarding the vaccinated participants, 58.5% were females, the mean age was 18.1 years, and the mean BMI was 25.3. There were statistically non-significant correlations (<i>p</i> &#x2c3; 0.05) between gender, BMI, and each of IgM- or IgG-positivity in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups. In total, 41.5% and 48.5% of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM-positive and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive participants were non-vaccinated, respectively. Furthermore, 58.5% and 51.5% of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM-positive and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive participants were vaccinated, respectively. No statistically significant association (<i>p</i> &#x2c3; 0.05) in immunoglobulins positivity between the anti-SARS-CoV-2 non-vaccinated, and vaccinated groups. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunological response of nonsmokers, people who exercise regularly, and those who take vitamin supplements, eat a balanced diet, and use certain herbs is noteworthy. Among the vaccinated subjects, 96.6%, 25.0%, 31.9%, 45.7%, and 7.8% of the IgG-positive group, versus 97.2%, 60.6%, 64.2%, 52.3%, and 6.4% of the IgG-positive non-vaccinated group, were nonsmokers, exercisers, and those taking vitamin supplements, eating a balanced diet, and using herbs, respectively. Furthermore, 93.5%, 32.3%, 35.5%, 48.4%, and 6.5% of the IgM-positive vaccinated group, versus 100.0%, 63.6%, 81.8%, 45.5%, and 4.5% of the IgM-positive non-vaccinated participants, were nonsmokers, physical exercisers, vitamin supplement users, balanced eaters, and herbalists, respectively. Persons who are free from comorbidities, young, non-obese, non-smokers, engage in physical exercise, take vitamins, eat a balanced diet, and use certain immunostimulant herbal supplements, all have a strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral immune response, even if they were not vaccinated. During pandemics, vaccination of this group should not be a priority to preserve vaccine doses for high-risk vulnerable people. Even if there is a lockdown during an anticipated future epidemic or pandemic, we should prioritize healthy eating and lifestyle choices, along with increasing physical activity.\n",

            "The nasal epithelium is the primary site for entry of respiratory viruses. In comparison to oral administration, nasal drug applications directed locally to the site of infection can serve as early interventional barriers against respiratory virus pathogenesis by limiting viral spread in the upper airway. Experiments on the diffusion of methylene blue and nanoparticles in both water and low pH conditions revealed that hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) can act as an effective physical barrier. This study also evaluated the activity of HPMC as a barrier against common respiratory viruses, i.e., rhinovirus (RV) and influenza A virus (IAV) using the in vitro human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) model. Utilizing the hNEC infection model, we assessed the protective effects of HPMC in pH 3.5 and pH 7 buffers against RV and IAV. Acidic and pH-neutral buffers and HPMC dissolved in acidic and pH-neutral buffers were administered for 4 h prior to virus infection and at 4 h post-infection (hpi). The apical supernatant was harvested at 24 hpi to determine the viral loads of RV and IAV (H1N1 and H3N2). HPMC was demonstrated to exert protective effects in the infected hNECs independent of acidic pH. Pre-treatment with HPMC in acidic buffer significantly diminished viral loads for both RV and IAV infections of hNECs. Similarly, direct treatment of HPMC in acidic buffer after infection (4 hpi) also effectively decreased viral loads of both RV and IAV. Moreover, treatment using HPMC in acidic buffer before or after infection did not affect the epithelial integrity and ciliary function of hNECs. This study demonstrates the protective effects of HPMC in acidic buffer against RV and IAV infections of the human nasal epithelium.\n",

It was reported that the number of EBV infections as well as the age characteristics of infected persons before and after the COVID-19 pandemic significantly decreased in children from China. Since no studies have explored the changes in EBV-associated lymphomas so far, our aim was to explore EBV infection and viral-associated Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in a pediatric cohort from a single center. A decrease in EBV+ children by serology was proved, in particular, in those undergoing primary infection, along with a significant increase in the mean age of healthy carriers. Furthermore, a decrease in EBV-associated pediatric cHL was observed post-pandemic, particularly in the NS subtype, with a marked decrease in cases diagnosed from 2022 onward. Even though the underlying reasons for the change in incidence rates seen in this study still remain speculative, it could be hypothesized that, after the pandemic, older children have a better ability to control the EBV-mediated lymphomagenesis, based on the fact that the age of infected patients increased.\n",

While BP's role in co-infections is increasingly recognized, its impact on later life stages remains unclear. Despite advancements in molecular diagnostics, its high genetic diversity complicates reliable detection, often leading to discrepancies between PCR results and histological observations of occlusion bodies. This study evaluated seven primer pairs for BP detection in <i>Penaeus vannamei</i>. Among histologically confirmed cases, only 6% tested positive with the BPA/BPF primer and 3% with BPA/BPB, while the remaining primers failed to amplify BP, highlighting significant diagnostic limitations. Histopathology revealed bacterial co-infections alongside BP, with advanced cases showing intranuclear occlusion bodies, hepatopancreatic necrosis, and epithelial detachment. These findings underscore the urgent need for improved molecular diagnostics to accurately assess BP prevalence, its role in co-infections, and its overall impact on shrimp health in Latin America. Further research is essential to refine detection methods and determine BP's pathogenic significance beyond early developmental stages.\n",

Since its identification in 1955, OROV has been responsible for outbreaks in both rural and urban areas, with transmission involving sylvatic and urban cycles. This study focuses on the characterization of an OROV isolate from a human clinical sample collected in the state of Rio de Janeiro, a non-endemic region in Brazil, highlighting ultrastructural and morphological aspects of the viral replicative cycle in Vero cells. OROV was isolated in Vero cell monolayers which, following viral inoculation, exhibited marked cytopathic effects (CPEs), mainly represented by changes in cell morphology, including membrane protrusions and vacuolization, as well as cell death. Studies by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed significant ultrastructural changes, such as apoptosis, intense remodeling of membrane-bound organelles and signs of rough endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial stress. Additionally, the formation of specialized cytoplasmic vacuoles and intra- and extracellular vesicles emphasized trafficking and intercellular communication as essential mechanisms in OROV infection. RT-qPCR studies confirmed the production of viral progeny in high titers, corroborating the efficiency of this experimental model. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the cytopathogenic mechanisms of OROV infection and the contribution of cellular alterations in OROV morphogenesis.\n",

Enteroviruses, including CV-A24v, are responsible for global AHC outbreaks. Over time, CV-A24v has evolved, and genotype IV (GIV) has become the dominant strain. This study focused on examining the genetic features and evolutionary trends of CV-A24v responsible for the recent AHC outbreak of 2023 in India. Researchers isolated viral strains from ocular swabs and confirmed the presence of CV-A24v using reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and whole-genome sequencing. Genomic comparisons between isolates of 2023 and those from a previous outbreak in 2009 were conducted. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 2023 isolates formed a distinct cluster within GIV-5 and were related to recent strains from China and Pakistan. The older Indian isolates from 2009 grouped with GIV-3. New subclades, GIV-6 and GIV-7, were also identified in this study, indicating the diversification of CV-A24. Molecular clock and phylogeographic analysis traced the virus's circulation back to the 1960s, with the common ancestor likely to have originated in Singapore in 1968. The 2023 Indian strains probably originated from Thailand around 2014, with subsequent spread to China and Pakistan. This study concluded that the 2023 outbreak was caused by a genetically distinct CV-A24v strain with nine mutations, underlining the virus's ongoing evolution and adaptations and offering valuable insights for future outbreak control.\n",

This study aims to establish a multi-gene combined RT-PCR assay for the rapid specific, sensitive, and reliable detection of MDMV without the need for special expensive equipment. Samples of imported maize, sorghum, and barley were collected from ports in Fujian and Shanghai. Primers targeting the coat protein (CP) and cytoplasmic inclusion protein (CI) genes of MDMV were designed and optimized. Through the design and screening of primers, as well as the optimization of reaction conditions and primer concentrations, a multi-gene combined RT-PCR assay was established to simultaneously detect both genes. Additionally, a real-time fluorescent-based RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) assay was developed using the CP gene to confirm the accuracy of multi-gene combined RT-PCR assay. The sensitivity of the optimized multi-gene combined RT-PCR assay enables the detection of MDMV in infected maize leaf crude extracts at dilutions of 5.37 pg/&#x3bc;L. This assay exhibited excellent specificity, high sensitivity, and robust repeatability, providing swift and accurate detection of MDMV.

            "Acute HIV-1 infection (AHI) is a transient period where the virus causes evident damage to the immune system, including an extensive apoptosis of CD4+ T cells associated with a high level of activation and a major cytokine storm to fight the invading virus. HIV infection establishes persistence by integrating the viral genome into host cell DNA in both replicating and non-replicating forms, effectively hiding from immune surveillance within infected lymphocytes as cellular reservoirs. The measurement of total HIV-1 DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is a reliable reflection of this reservoir. Initiating treatments during AHI with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and/or integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) is essential to alter the dynamics of the global reservoir expansion, and to reduce the establishment of long-lived cellular and tissue reservoirs, while preserving and enhancing specific and non-specific immune responses. Furthermore, some of the patients treated at the AHI stage may become post-treatment controllers and should be informative regarding the mechanism of viral control, so patients treated during AHI are undoubtedly the best candidates to test innovative remission strategies toward a functional cure that could play a pivotal role in long-term HIV control. AHI is characterized by high levels of viral replication, with a significant increase in the risk of HIV transmission. Detecting AHI and initiating early treatment following diagnosis provides a window of opportunity to control the epidemic, particularly in high-risk populations.\n",

            "Bacterial viruses (phages) are abundant and ecologically impactful, but laboratory-based experimental model systems vastly under-represent known phage diversity, particularly for ssDNA phages. Here, we characterize the genomes and infection properties of two unrelated marine flavophages-ssDNA generalist phage phi18:4 (6.5 Kbp) and dsDNA specialist phage phi18:1 (39.2 Kbp)-when infecting the same <i>Cellulophaga baltica</i> strain #18 (Cba18), of the class <i>Flavobacteriia</i>. Phage phi18:4 belongs to a new family of ssDNA phages, has an internal lipid membrane, and its genome encodes primarily structural proteins, as well as a DNA replication protein common to ssDNA phages and a unique lysis protein. Phage phi18:1 is a siphovirus that encodes several virulence genes, despite not having a known temperate lifestyle, a CAZy enzyme likely for regulatory purposes, and four DNA methyltransferases dispersed throughout the genome that suggest both host modulation and phage DNA protection against host restriction. Physiologically, ssDNA phage phi18:4 has a shorter latent period and smaller burst size than dsDNA phage phi18:1, and both phages efficiently infect this host. These results help augment the diversity of characterized environmental phage-host model systems by studying infections of genomically diverse phages (ssDNA vs. dsDNA) on the same host.\n",

            "Within-host evolution plays a critical role in shaping the diversity of SARS-CoV-2. However, understanding the primary factors contributing to the prevalence of intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) in the viral population remains elusive. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of over 556,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data and prevalence data of different SARS-CoV-2 S protein amino acid mutations to elucidate key factors influencing the prevalence of iSNVs in the SARS-CoV-2 <i>S</i> gene. Within-host diversity analysis revealed the presence of mutational hotspots within the <i>S</i> gene, mainly located in NTD, RBD, TM, and CT domains. Additionally, we generated a single amino acid resolution selection status map of the S protein. We observed a significant variance in within-host fitness among iSNVs in the S protein. The majority of iSNVs exhibited low to no within-host fitness and displayed low alternate allele frequency (AAF), suggesting that they will be eliminated due to the narrow transmission bottleneck of SARS-CoV-2. Notably, iSNVs with moderate AAFs (0.06-0.12) were found to be more prevalent than those with high AAFs. Furthermore, iSNVs with the potential to alter antigenicity were more prevalent. These findings underscore the significance of within-host fitness and antigenicity shift as two key factors influencing the prevalence of iSNVs in the SARS-CoV-2 <i>S</i> gene.\n",

            "A key contributor to the pathogenicity of viruses is their interaction with cellular defense mechanisms, including UPR (unfolded protein response) that counteracts the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (known as ER stress). One of the UPR branches is mediated by the IRE1 (inositol-requiring enzyme 1) protein, which possesses protein kinase and RNase activities that facilitate the unconventional cytoplasmic splicing of XBP1 mRNA, leading to the upregulation of the XBP1 transcription factor. In this study, we demonstrate that Encephalomyocarditis Virus (<i>Cardiovirus rueckerti</i>) is able to suppress IRE1-dependent XBP1 activation. HeLa cells infection with EMCV resulted in the modulation of phosphorylated IRE1 levels throughout the infection cycle. Viral infection did not result in the accumulation of spliced XBP1 mRNA. Moreover, the addition of a chemical inducer of ER stress (dithiothreitol) to infected cells led to a markedly lower accumulation of spliced XBP1 mRNA as compared to the level of this mRNA in inducer-treated mock-infected cells. Thus, our results demonstrate the ability of picornaviruses to modulate another defensive activity of the host cell.\n",

            "Methamphetamine (METH) use is frequent among people with HIV (PWH) and appears to increase the risk of neuronal injury and neurocognitive impairment (NCI). This study explored in vivo the effects of a 12 week (long-term), low-dose METH regimen in a transgenic animal model of neuroHIV with inducible expression of HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat). Seven months after transient Tat induction and five months after METH exposure ended, we detected behavioral changes in the Barnes maze (BM) spatial memory task in the Tat and METH groups but not the combined Tat + METH group. The novel object recognition (NOR) task revealed that Tat extinguished discrimination in female animals with and without METH, although METH alone slightly improved NOR. In contrast, in males, Tat, METH, and Tat + METH all compromised NOR. Neuropathological examination detected sex-dependent and brain region-specific changes of pre-synaptic terminals, neurites, and activation of astrocytes and microglia. RNA-sequencing and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction indicated that METH and Tat significantly altered gene expression, including factors linked to Alzheimer's disease-like NCI. In summary, chronic low-dose METH exerts long-term effects on behavioral function, neuropathology, and mRNA expression, and modulates the effects of Tat, suggesting sex-dependent and -independent mechanisms may converge in HIV brain injury and NCI.\n",

            "This study aimed to identify possible early biomarkers of mortality among clinical and biochemical parameters, iron metabolism parameters, and cytokines detected within 24 h from admission in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We enrolled 80 hospitalized patients (40 survivors and 40 non-survivors) with COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. The median time from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to hospital admission was lower in non-survivors than survivors (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Respiratory failure, expressed as the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to the fraction of inspired oxygen (P/F), was more severe in non-survivors than survivors (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Comorbidities were similar in both groups. Among biochemical parameters and cytokines, eGFR and interleukin (IL)-1&#x3b2; were found to be significantly lower (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), while LDH, IL-10, and IL-8 were significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0005, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 and <i>p</i> &lt; 0.005, respectively). Among other parameters, LDH values distribution showed the most significant difference between study groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). LASSO feature selection combined with Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models was applied to identify features distinguishing between survivors and non-survivors. Both approaches highlighted LDH as the strongest predictor, with IL-22 and creatinine emerging in the Cox model, while IL-10, eGFR, and creatinine were influential in the logistic model (AUC = 0.744 for Cox, 0.723 for logistic regression). In a similar manner, we applied linear regression for predicting LDH levels, identifying the P/F ratio as the top predictor, followed by IL-10 and eGFR (NRMSE = 0.128). Collectively, these findings underscore LDH's critical role in mortality prediction, with P/F and IL-10 as key determinants of LDH increases in this Italian COVID-19 cohort.\n",

In order to detect seven pathogens simultaneously, a visual gene chip for the detection of multiple waterfowl disease pathogens was developed in this study. The gene chip was capable of specifically amplifying GPV, DEV, MDPV, DHAV-1, -DHAV-3, DTMUV, and NDRV. The sensitivity results showed that the lowest detection limit of the gene chip was 1 copy/&#x3bc;L for single and mixed samples. The reproducibility and stability tests demonstrated that the gene chip developed in this experiment exhibited not only excellent reproducibility but also remarkable stability, remaining functional for a minimum of 180 days. Compared to qPCR methods, the results showed that the sensitivity of the gene chip was slightly better than that of the qPCR method in detecting both single and mixed pathogens of the seven viruses. In this study, a total of 210 clinical samples were detected by the gene chip and qPCR, respectively, and the results of the two methods had a concordance rate of 98.1~100%, with a kappa value of 0.952, indicating that the consistency of the two detection methods was good.\n",

            "Presepsin, a cleaved peptide of soluble CD14, may become a promising biomarker for assessing disease severity and mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients with severe COVID-19 frequently develop bacterial and fungal superinfections, as well as herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) reactivation, which may exacerbate disease progression. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of concomitant infections on serum presepsin levels. Serum presepsin levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 63 patients with moderate COVID-19, 60 patients with severe disease, and 49 healthy controls. Correlations with procalcitonin and the presence of superinfections or HSV-1 reactivation were assessed. Consistent with previous studies, serum presepsin levels were the highest in patients with severe COVID-19 (<i>p</i> = 0.002 compared to patients with moderate disease). Within this group, non-survivors exhibited significantly elevated presepsin levels (<i>p</i> = 0.027). A positive correlation between presepsin and procalcitonin was observed in both moderate and severe COVID-19 cases. Patients with bacterial or fungal superinfections showed presepsin levels comparable to those without secondary infections. However, presepsin levels were markedly elevated in patients with HSV-1 reactivation (<i>p</i> = 0.002). After excluding patients with HSV-1 reactivation, presepsin levels no longer differed between moderate and severe COVID-19 cases, though they remained higher than in healthy controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 for both comparisons). In conclusion, these findings suggest that elevated serum presepsin levels in severe COVID-19 are primarily driven by HSV-1 reactivation rather than bacterial or fungal superinfections.\n",

To address this challenge, we developed the AliMarko pipeline, a tool designed to streamline virus identification in metagenomic data. Our pipeline uses a dual approach, combining mapping reads with reference genomes and a de novo assembly-based approach involving an HMM-based homology search and phylogenetic analysis, to enable comprehensive detection of viral sequences, including low-coverage and divergent sequences. We applied our pipeline to total RNA sequencing of bat feces and identified a range of viruses, quickly validating viral sequences and assessing their phylogenetic relationships. We hope that the AliMarko pipeline will be a useful resource for the scientific community, facilitating the interpretation of viral communities and advancing our understanding of viral diversity and its impact on human health.\n",

However, compared to other age groups, only 23.2% of children aged 1-5 years showed nAbs to EV71 genotype D with a considerably lower Geometric Mean Titer, indicating the susceptibility of this age group to EV71 infection. Our study confirms the circulation of EV71 in India with relatively high susceptibility of children up to 5 years to EV71 infections.\n",

            "Hendra virus (HeV) is a bat-borne zoonotic agent which can cause a severe and highly fatal disease and can be transferred from animals to humans. It has caused over 100 deaths in horses since it was discovered in 1994. Four out of seven infected humans have died. Since the release of the HeV vaccine (Equivac<sup>&#xae;</sup> HeV Hendra Virus Vaccine for Horses, Zoetis Australia Pty Ltd., Rhodes, NSW 2138) in Australia, there has been an urgent requirement for a serological test for differentiating infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). All first-line diagnostic serological assays at the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness (ACDP) incorporate recombinant HeV soluble G glycoprotein (sG) as the antigen, which is also the only immunogen present in the Equivac<sup>&#xae;</sup> HeV vaccine. Problems therefore arose in that antibody testing results were unable to distinguish between prior vaccination or infection with HeV. This study describes the development of a HeV DIVA ELISA strategy using recombinant sG and HeV nucleoprotein (N), paired with specific monoclonal antibodies in a competition ELISA format. The validation of this assay strategy was performed using a positive cohort of 19 serum samples representing post-infection sera, a negative cohort of 1138 serum samples representing horse sera collected pre-vaccine release and a vaccination cohort of 502 serum samples from horses previously vaccinated with Equivac<sup>&#xae;</sup> HeV vaccine. For the sG glycoprotein, the diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) was 100.0% (95% CI: 99.3-100.0%) and diagnostic specificity (DSp) 99.91% (95% CI: 99.5-100.0%), using a percentage inhibition cut-off value of &gt;36, whereas for the N protein, DSe was 100.0% (95% CI: 82.4-100.0%) and DSp 100.0% (95% CI: 99.7-100.0%), using a percentage inhibition cut-off value of &gt;49. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the HeV DIVA ELISA strategy developed here is now an essential and critical component of the testing algorithm for HeV serology testing in Australia.\n",

            "Zoonotic viruses have significant pandemic potential, as evidenced by the coronavirus pandemic, which underscores that zoonotic infections have historically caused numerous outbreaks and millions of deaths over centuries. Zoonotic viruses induce numerous types of illnesses in their natural hosts. These viruses are transmitted to humans via biological vectors, direct contact with infected animals or their bites, and aerosols. Zoonotic viruses continuously evolve and adapt to human hosts, resulting in devastating consequences. It is very important to understand pathogenesis pathways associated with zoonotic viral infections across various hosts and develop countermeasure strategies accordingly. In this review, we briefly discuss advancements in diagnostics and therapeutics for zoonotic viral infections. It provides insight into recent outbreaks, viral dynamics, licensed vaccines, as well as vaccine candidates progressing to clinical investigations. Despite advancements, challenges persist in combating zoonotic viruses due to immune evasion, unpredicted outbreaks, and the complexity of the immune responses. Most of these viruses lack effective treatments and vaccines, relying entirely on supportive care and preventive measures. Exposure to animal reservoirs, limited vaccine access, and insufficient coverage further pose challenges to preventive efforts. This review highlights the critical need for ongoing interdisciplinary research and collaboration to strengthen preparedness and response strategies against emerging infectious threats.\n",

In Brazil, substantial efforts have been made over the years to combat the burden caused by hepatitis B through public health interventions, including vaccination programs, antenatal screening, and prevention of vertical transmission. However, despite these advancements, disparities in disease trends persist across regions and vulnerable populations, requiring ongoing analysis and intervention. This study aimed to analyze the trend in hospital admissions for hepatitis B in Brazil from 2008 to 2023. Data were collected from the SUS Hospital Information System. Statistical analyses were conducted using the Joinpoint Regression Program (version 5.0.2), applying a 5% significance level to identify significant trends over the study period. A total of 19,735 hospitalizations for hepatitis B were recorded during the study period. The overall trend showed a significant decline in hospital admissions, reflecting the effectiveness of public health interventions such as expanded vaccination coverage, screening programs, and prevention strategies. Despite this overall decline, notable regional disparities were observed. The midwest region exhibited an increasing trend in hospitalizations, contrasting with the national decline. Furthermore, a concerning rise in hospital admissions among infants under one year of age was identified, indicating potential shortcomings in the prevention of the vertical transmission of the virus. This study highlights both the successes and persistent challenges in controlling hepatitis B hospitalizations in Brazil. Maintaining high vaccination coverage and implementing targeted public health campaigns for vulnerable populations are crucial for sustaining progress. The regional disparities and failures in vertical transmission prevention require continued attention and intervention to advance toward the goal of eliminating hepatitis B as a public health threat in Brazil.\n",

In the present study, we explored the underlying cause by assessing the efficiency of generating influenza C virus-like particles (C-VLPs) containing specific virus RNA (vRNA) segments. Using 293T cells transfected with plasmids encoding GFP- and DsRed2-vRNAs (each flanked by the non-coding regions of Segments 5 and 6, respectively), along with plasmids expressing virus proteins, we observed that C-VLPs containing a single vRNA segment were generated efficiently. However, the simultaneous packaging of two vRNA segments into a single C-VLP was less frequent, as demonstrated by flow cytometry and reverse-transcription PCR analyses. Statistical evaluations revealed a decreased efficiency of incorporating multiple vRNA segments into single particles, which likely contributes to the reduced production of infectious virus particles in reverse genetics systems. These findings highlight a critical limitation in the vRNA incorporation mechanism of influenza C virus, contrasting with that of influenza A virus. Hence, further studies are required to elucidate specific vRNA packaging signals and optimize vRNA expression levels to improve the production of infectious influenza C virus particles.\n",

Currently, there are no approved antiviral drugs or vaccines available for EHV-8 control. In this study, we investigated the antiviral efficacy of celastrol against EHV-8 both in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrated that celastrol significantly inhibited EHV-8 infection in Rabbit kidney (RK-13) and equine dermal cells (NBL-6) in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistic studies revealed that celastrol interfered with viral replication at multiple stages of the infection cycle. Furthermore, we found that celastrol induced an antiviral interferon response through activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Importantly, celastrol treatment significantly reduced EHV-8 replication and ameliorated lung pathology in a mouse model. These findings suggest that celastrol may represent a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of EHV-8 infections.\n",

However, comprehensive evidence on the specific dengue virus (DENV) serotypes and genotypes involved remains limited. During the 2023 DF outbreak, the National Arbovirus Laboratory received seventy serum samples from suspected DF patients. Positive samples underwent sequencing of the CprM region of the DENV genome, and the obtained sequences were analyzed phylogenetically. Among the patients, 32 (45.7%) displayed early warning signs of severe dengue, and 13 were hospitalized, most showing symptoms indicative of severe dengue. Out of 67 adequate samples, 44 (65.6%) tested positive for DENV RNA by RT-PCR, and 17 successfully underwent CprM sequencing. All sequenced samples were identified as DENV-3, genotype III, major lineage B (DENV-3III_B), with two distinct minor lineages (DENV-3III_B.2 and DENV-3III_B.3). Phylogenetic analysis showed that these lineages were closely related to sequences from the Afar region, suggesting interconnected outbreaks with multiple co-circulating lineages. This study identifies DENV-3III_B as the cause of the 2023 DF outbreak in Dire Dawa City and highlights the need for enhanced viral genomic surveillance in Africa.\n",

Vaccination studies in a nonhuman primate (NHP) model guided initial dose selection for clinical trial evaluation. We summarize two dose-ranging studies with the clinical-grade rVSV&#x394;G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine candidate to assess the impact of dose level on immune responses and efficacy in an NHP Ebola virus (EBOV) challenge model. Forty-six cynomolgus macaques were vaccinated with a wide range of rVSV&#x394;G-ZEBOV-GP doses and challenged 42 days later intramuscularly with 1000 pfu EBOV. Vaccination with rVSV&#x394;G-ZEBOV-GP induced relatively high levels of EBOV-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies, measured using the same validated assays as used in rVSV&#x394;G-ZEBOV-GP clinical trials. Similar responses were observed across dose groups from 1 &#xd7; 10<sup>8</sup> to 1 &#xd7; 10<sup>2</sup> pfu. A single vaccination conferred 98% protection from lethal intramuscular EBOV challenge across all dose groups. These results demonstrate that robust antibody titers are induced in NHPs across a wide range of rVSV&#x394;G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine doses, correlating with high levels of protection against death from EBOV challenge.\n",

            "(1) Background: The C-type lectin domain family 4 member M (CLEC4M, also known as L-SIGN) is a crucial pathogen-recognition receptor for the dengue virus (DENV). Our previous study has exhibited a polymorphism in its extracellular neck region, specifically within the long tandem repeats of exon 4, which correlates with DHF in DENV infection and causes liver damage. (2) Methods: Using monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) and SK-HEP1 liver endothelial cell lines to compare viral replication relative to L-SIGN expression. (3) Results: Results indicated that SK-HEP1 cells were more susceptible to DENV infection than MDDCs, and L-SIGN transfection significantly increased viral replication in SK-HEP1 cell lines. The study also found that L-SIGN-enhanced DENV infection is mediated by the decrease in monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) but not interferon gamma inducible protein-10 (IP-10). These findings reveal that L-SIGN-induced DENV infection leads to reduced MCP-1 levels, which, in turn, enhances DENV replication velocity. (4) Conclusions: This study offers insights into the molecular mechanisms of DENV replication and identifies potential therapeutic targets involving MCP-1 and L-SIGN pathways.\n",

            "The rVSV&#x394;G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine demonstrated efficacy in preventing Ebola virus (EBOV) disease in a ring vaccination clinical trial conducted during the 2014-2016 West Africa outbreak and is licensed by regulatory agencies, including the US FDA and the EMA. Here, we present two studies that evaluated the durability of immunogenicity and protection from an EBOV challenge up to ~12 months following vaccination with rVSV&#x394;G-ZEBOV-GP in nonhuman primates (NHPs). Cynomolgus macaques were vaccinated with either one or two doses of rVSV&#x394;G-ZEBOV-GP or a saline control and were challenged intramuscularly with EBOV at a target dose of 1000 pfu at ~4 months (Study 1) or ~8 or ~12 months (Study 2) after the last vaccination. All vaccinated animals developed robust ZEBOV-GP-specific IgG and neutralizing antibody titers, which were sustained until the last time point tested prior to the challenge. The majority of animals (88-93%) challenged with EBOV at ~4 or ~8 months post-vaccination survived, whereas the survival rate was lower (53%) in animals challenged ~12 months post-vaccination. These results demonstrate that both one-dose and two-dose regimens of the rVSV&#x394;G-ZEBOV-GP vaccine induced durable ZEBOV-GP-specific antibody titers in NHPs and provided high levels of protection against a lethal EBOV challenge up to ~8 months post-vaccination. In this stringent challenge model, decreased protection was observed at ~12 months post-vaccination despite sustained antibody levels.\n",

            "Rabies virus (RABV; species <i>Lyssavirus rabies</i>) causes rabies, a disease of the central nervous system that invariably results in the death of the host. In South Africa, studies have indicated that RABV is maintained by animal species that include four wildlife carnivore species-the black-backed jackal (<i>Canis mesomelas</i>), bat-eared fox (<i>Otocyon megalotis</i>), yellow mongoose (<i>Cynictis penicillata</i>), and aardwolf (<i>Proteles cristatus</i>)-and domestic dogs (<i>Canis lupus familiaris</i>). The complex natural ecology holds significant implications for the control and elimination of rabies. In this study, confirmed animal rabies case data, including geospatial features, were analyzed for 12,879 laboratory-confirmed animal cases reported on a database managed by the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development (DALRRD). Sequence data generated from animal rabies cases in South Africa were also analyzed, which included 1374 cytoplasmic domain of the glycoprotein and the G-L intergenic sequences using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference. The analysis provides insights into the transmission dynamics involving several wildlife species and domestic dogs in South Africa. This information is crucial for the strategic planning for rabies control and elimination programs, and particularly in understanding the interlinked nature of some lineages and the importance of the cross-border spread of rabies. This analysis provided an improved understanding of the distribution of the RABV lineages in South Africa and identified areas that can be targeted for rabies control strategies to limit future spread of RABV, which is important due to the limited available resources that must be carefully managed to allow optimal control.\n",

            "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major zoonotic pathogen causing hepatitis E, with strains identified in various animal species, including pigs, wild boar, rabbits, deer, camels, and rats. These variants are capable of crossing species barriers and infecting humans. HEV belongs to the family <i>Hepeviridae</i>, which has recently divided into two subfamilies: <i>Orthohepevirinae</i> and <i>Parahepevirinae</i>, and five genera: <i>Paslahepevirus</i>, <i>Avihepevirus</i>, <i>Rocahepevirus</i>, <i>Chirohepevirus</i>, and <i>Piscihepevirus</i>. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing, particularly of bat viromes, have revealed numerous HEV-related viruses, raising concerns about their zoonotic potential. Bat-derived HEVs have been classified into the genus <i>Chirohepevirus</i>, which includes three distinct species. In this study, we analyzed 64 chirohepevirus sequences from 22 bat species across six bat families collected from nine countries. Twelve sequences represent complete or nearly complete viral genomes (&gt;6410 nucleotides) containing the characteristic three HEV open reading frames (ORFs). These strains exhibited high sequence divergence (&gt;25%) within their respective host genera or species. Phylogenetic analyses with maximum likelihood methods identified at least seven distinct subclades within <i>Chirohepevirus</i>, each potentially representing an independent species. Additionally, the close phylogenetic relationship between chirohepevirus strains and their bat hosts indicates a pattern of virus-host co-speciation. Our findings expand the known diversity within the family <i>Hepeviridae</i> and provide new insights into the evolution of bat-associated HEV. Continued surveillance of chirohepevirus will be essential for understanding its potential for zoonotic transmission and public health risks.\n",

            "(1) Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major health challenge. Although vaccination protects people from HBV infection, 5-10% of people at risk of HBV infection and associated liver diseases do not respond to vaccination. The association of hematological indices with vaccine response is a crucial contributing factor in HBV-associated liver damage and the outcome of patients. In this context, we clinically assessed the interaction between inflammatory parameters and Hepatitis B vaccine response for the first time. (2) Methods: In total, 90 volunteers (44 non-responders and 46 responders) were included in this retrospective study. The demographic data and the hemogram parameters of the volunteers were recorded and statistically analyzed. Additionally, systemic inflammation index (SII), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were calculated. (3) Results: Our results indicate that higher median levels of white blood cells (8.61), lymphocytes (2.37), neutrophils (5.71), and platelets (280) were determined in the non-responders compared to the responders. SII and NLR indices were significantly higher in the non-responders than in the responders (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). (4) Conclusions: The non-responders exerted higher systemic inflammation indicators than the responders, and the NLR value partially distinguished Hepatitis B vaccine response. Nevertheless, further studies with larger cohorts are essential to confirm the clinical utility of systemic inflammatory response as a reliable criterion for predicting Hepatitis B vaccine responsiveness.\n",

            "The extensive genetic diversity of HIV-1 represents a major challenge to public health interventions, treatment, and successful vaccine design. This challenge is particularly pronounced in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, where limited data among other barriers preclude the accurate characterization of HIV-1 genetic diversity. The objective of this review was to analyze studies conducted in the MENA region to delineate possible barriers that would hinder the accurate depiction of HIV-1 genetic diversity in this region. A systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar was conducted for published records on HIV-1 genetic diversity in the English language up until 1 October 2024 across 18 MENA countries. The pre-defined themes of challenges/barriers included limited sampling, data gaps, resource and infrastructure constraints, HIV-1-specific factors, and socio-cultural barriers. A total of 38 records were included in the final review, comprising original articles (55.3%), reviews (21.1%), and sequence notes (10.5%). Libya (15.8%), Morocco (13.2%), Saudi Arabia, and MENA as a whole (10.5% for each) were the primary sources of the included records. Of the 23 records with original MENA HIV-1 sequences, the median number of sequences was 46 (range: 6-193). The identified barriers included the following: (1) low sampling density; (2) limited clinical data (21.7% with no data, 60.9% partial data, and 17.4% with full data); (3) reliance solely on population sequencing and insufficient use of advanced sequencing technologies; (4) lack of comprehensive recombination analysis; and (5) socio-cultural barriers, including stigma with subsequent under-reporting among at-risk groups. The barriers identified in this review can hinder the ability to map the genetic diversity of HIV-1 in the MENA. Poor characterization of HIV-1's genetic diversity in the MENA would hinder efforts to optimize prevention strategies, monitor drug resistance, and develop MENA-specific treatment protocols. To overcome these challenges, investment in public health/research infrastructure, policy reforms to reduce stigma, and strengthened regional collaboration are recommended.\n",

Virus plaque assays are commonly used to assess the antiviral effects of drugs on virus replication; however, this method is labor-intensive and can present challenges. We avoided this method by using a replication-competent influenza A virus (IAV) expressing a reporter fluorescent gene fused to the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) gene. The reporter IAV was detectable in normal human bronchoepithelial (NHBE) infected cells and offered an improved method to determine the therapeutic efficacy of the antiviral drugs probenecid and oseltamivir compared to a standard plaque assay.

            "The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic significantly impacted the circulation patterns of respiratory viruses worldwide. To better understand viral circulation patterns during the transition from pandemic to endemic phase, we conducted comprehensive respiratory virus surveillance in Mie Prefecture, Japan, during 2021-2023, coinciding with the Delta-to-Omicron transition of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We collected respiratory specimens from acute respiratory infection patients in medical institutions, detecting 19 respiratory viruses using real-time PCR in 1573 valid samples out of 1605 specimens. Demographic and clinical data were available for some specimens. SARS-CoV-2 Omicron strains showed a peak positivity of 15-25% during the epidemic, while respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus/enterovirus exhibited one to two annual epidemic peaks up to 57%, and human adenovirus maintained a positivity rate of 5-20% throughout the year. Age-dependent analysis revealed the significant detection of multiple viruses, particularly in children under 2 years, with up to six viruses detected simultaneously in those under 5 years. Our findings demonstrate varied respiratory virus prevalence patterns, with some viruses remaining active during the Omicron epidemic, suggesting its limited impact on other viruses. This comprehensive approach should enhance the understanding of respiratory virus epidemic dynamics and inform public health strategies.\n",

Moreover, viruses of this clade are known to cause infections in mammals, posing a potential pandemic threat. Due to the ongoing evolution and change in the dominant strains of H5 clade 2.3.4.4b, it is important to investigate the cross-reactivity of vaccines in use and under development against clade 2.3.4.4b viruses. In this study, the immunogenicity of the previously developed DNA vaccine encoding a modified hemagglutinin of the influenza A/turkey/Stavropol/320-01/2020 (H5N8) virus, administered by jet injection at doses of 1, 10, 50, 100, and 200 &#x3bc;g, was investigated. The highest titer of specific to recombinant hemagglutinin antibodies was detected in the group of animals injected with 100 &#xb5;g of DNA vaccine. The cross-reactivity study of sera of animals immunized with 100 &#xb5;g of DNA vaccine in a microneutralization assay against the strains A/chicken/Astrakhan/321-05/2020 (H5N8), A/chicken/Komi/24-4V/2023 (H5N1), and A/chicken/Khabarovsk/24-1V/2022 (H5N1) showed the formation of cross-neutralizing antibodies.

            "Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, various severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have emerged. Although the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the lungs, it can also affect the brain and induce neurological symptoms. However, the specific effects of different variants on the brain remain unclear. In this study, a whole-transcriptome analysis was conducted using the brain tissues of K18-hACE2 mice infected with the ancestral B.1 (Wuhan) variant and with major SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.529 (Omicron). After sequencing, differential gene expression, gene ontology (GO) and genome pathway enrichment analyses were performed. An Immune Cell Abundance Identifier (ImmuCellAI) was used to identify the abundance of different cell populations. Additionally, RT-qPCR was used to validate the RNA-seq data. The viral load and hierarchical clustering analyses divided the samples into two different clusters with notable differences in gene expression at day 6 post-infection for all variants compared to the control group. GO and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes and genomes enrichment analyses revealed similar patterns of pathway enrichment for different variants. ImmuCellAI revealed the changes in immune cell populations, including the decrease in CD4<sup>+</sup> T and B cell proportions and the increase in CD8<sup>+</sup> T and dendritic cell proportions. A co-expression network analysis revealed that some genes, such as <i>STAT1</i>, interleukin-<i>6</i> (<i>IL-6</i>) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (<i>TNF-&#x3b1;</i>), were dysregulated in all variants. A RT-qPCR analysis for <i>IL-6</i>, <i>CXCL10</i> and <i>IRF7</i> further validated the RNA-seq analysis. In conclusion, this study provides, for the first time, an extensive transcriptome analysis of a K18-hACE2 mouse brain after infection with major SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n",

            "Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) and tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) are two important viral pathogens that severely affect <i>Solanaceae</i> and <i>Cucurbitaceae</i> plants. In order to reduce the further spread of these viruses, it is crucial to establish an efficient and reliable method to accurately detect the viruses. In this study, a multiplex PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of TYLCV and ToLCNDV was established. Three primer pairs designed from conserved regions within the coat protein or movement protein-encoding regions of the respective viruses were employed in the assay. The optimization of parameters such as primer concentration was set at 0.15 &#x3bc;M/0.15 &#x3bc;M, 0.25 &#x3bc;M/0.25 &#x3bc;M, and 0.50 &#x3bc;M/0.50 &#x3bc;M for ToLCNDV-DNA-A-F/R, TYLCV-F/R, and ToLCNDV-DNA-B-F/R primer pairs. At optimal primer concentrations, the multiplex PCR method demonstrates effective performance with an annealing temperature ranging from 51 &#xb0;C to 66 &#xb0;C. The specificity of the assay evaluated by testing against other begomoviruses showed no evidence of cross-amplification. Further sensitivity analysis performed using a serially diluted plasmid containing viral targets as templates demonstrated high sensitivity with a detection limit of 10<sup>3</sup> copies/&#x3bc;L. Field surveys utilizing the multiplex PCR assay successfully identified the infection of TYLCV and ToLCNDV in field-collected samples.\n",

In 2023, the introduction of genotype II ASFV into Lombardy was a cause for serious concern; the region is home to approximately 50% of the national pig population and is of economic importance to the processing industry of the entire country. Since then, two ASF epidemics have resulted in a total of 30 outbreaks in domestic pigs in the same areas of Lombardy, where the disease is endemic in wild boars. The results of the control activities conducted in the affected areas seem to indicate the establishment of self-sustaining infection cycles in the wild boar population with spillover and spillback events occurring between wild boars and domestic pigs.

To elucidate the molecular epidemiology of G2P[4] rotavirus in China and the protective effects of vaccines, whole-genome analysis of 13 G2P[4] RVA strains collected from China in 2022 was performed. Twelve strains possessed the typical DS-1-like genome constellation G2-P[4]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2. Only GS2265 possessed the genome constellation G2-P[4]-12-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E1-H2. With the exception of the NSP4 segment of GS2265, all other sequences of the 13 G2P[4] RVA strains clustered within the same lineage on phylogenetic analysis. However, QD2210 and SX2205 were grouped into different branches compared to the other strains. In the VP7 antigenic epitopes, four residues differed from the RotaTeq G2 strain; specifically, A87T and D96N in the 7-1a region and S213D and S242N in the 7-1b region. Comparison of the current G2P[4] RVA strains circulating in China with those circulating globally revealed a high degree of sequence identity. High genetic variability among the newly characterized G2P[4] RVA strains suggest the strains evolve fast. Finally, our data suggest that the multivalent RotaTeq vaccine could have provided better protection than the monovalent Rotarix and LLR.\n",

            "Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) is the most common infectious cause of birth defects worldwide, affecting approximately 1 in every 200 live-born infants globally. Recent work has identified potential immune correlates of protection against cCMV transmission including maternal and placentally transferred antibody levels and their function, which may inform the development of maternal active (vaccine) and passive (mono/polyclonal antibody) immunizations. However, these correlates need to also be assessed in diverse cohorts, including women living with HIV who have increased risk of cCMV transmission. Using a case-control design, we investigated whether the magnitude, specificity, function and placental transfer of maternal IgG responses are associated with protection against and/or risk of cCMV transmission in HIV/HCMV co-infection. Within 3 historical cohorts of pregnant women with HIV/HCMV co-infection, we identified 16 cCMV transmitting cases that were matched to 29 cCMV non-transmitting controls. Using a systems serology approach, we found that normalized HCMV-specific IgG binding to Fc&#x3b3;R1&#x3b1; was higher in non-transmitting dyads, whereas HCMV-neutralizing antibody responses were higher in transmitting dyads. These findings suggest that engagement of Fc&#x3b3;R1&#x3b1; by HCMV-specific IgG may help confer protection against cCMV transmission. Building upon previous research, our study reinforces the critical role of validating maternal humoral immune correlates of cCMV transmission risk across diverse seropositive cohorts, providing essential insights to inform and accelerate the development of effective HCMV vaccines.\n",

            "Despite significant advancements in early diagnosis and treatment, breast cancer (BC) remains a major global health challenge. Ongoing research is essential to identify novel risk factors, implement innovative screening programs, and develop personalized treatment approaches. Among the various risk factors, infection with certain oncogenic viruses has emerged as a potential contributor to BC development. Increasing evidence suggests that bovine leukemia virus (BLV) may contribute to zoonotic infections in humans, with a potential role in BC initiation and progression. This review evaluates clinical and experimental data on BLV presence in both malignant and non-malignant breast tissues, exploring potential mechanisms through which BLV may access human breast tissue and contribute to carcinogenesis. Current data reveal a higher prevalence of BLV infection in BC tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, correlating with an increased risk of BC development. In this context, dairy and meat products from BLV-infected animals have been proposed as potential transmission sources. BLV-encoded proteins disrupt key oncogenic pathways, which support their possible role in breast carcinogenesis. However, the interpretation of these findings is limited by potential confounding factors such as genetic predisposition, environmental exposures, and dietary influences. Further research, including well-controlled epidemiological studies, longitudinal cohorts, and mechanistic investigations into BLV proteins in human breast cells, is necessary to determine its role in BC development.\n",

            "The tropism of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) is determined by the use of either or both chemokine coreceptors CCR5 (R5) and CXCR4 (X4) for entry into the target cell. The ability of HIV-1 to bind R5 or X4 is determined primarily by the third variable loop (V3) of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120. HIV-1 strains of pandemic group M contain an antisense gene termed <i>asp</i>, which overlaps <i>env</i> outside the region encoding the V3 loop. We previously showed that the ASP protein localizes on the envelope of infectious HIV-1 virions, suggesting that it may play a role in viral entry. In this study, we first developed a statistical method to predict coreceptor tropism based on Fisher's linear discriminant analysis. We obtained three linear discriminant functions able to predict coreceptor tropism with high accuracy (94.4%) when applied to a training dataset of V3 sequences of known tropism. Using these functions, we predicted the tropism in a dataset of HIV-1 strains containing a full-length <i>asp</i> gene. In the amino acid sequence of ASP proteins expressed from these <i>asp</i> genes, we identified five positions with substitutions significantly associated with viral tropism. Interestingly, we found that these substitutions correlate significantly with substitutions at six amino acid positions of the V3 loop domain associated with tropism. Altogether, our computational analyses identify ASP amino acid signatures coevolving with V3 and potentially affecting HIV-1 tropism, which can be validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments.\n",

The condition primarily affects the larynx, potentially leading to life-threatening airway obstruction. It is more aggressive in younger patients, necessitating frequent surgical interventions. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of the prophylactic HPV vaccine Gardasil<sup>&#xae;</sup> in RRP patients, focusing on its impact on lesion size and the frequency of surgical interventions. Furthermore, a literature review was conducted to analyze the factors influencing the decision to vaccinate. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis was conducted on 63 RRP patients treated from 2008 to 2021. Disease burden was assessed using the Derkay score and the annual frequency of laser-surgical ablations. Comparisons were made between pre- and post-vaccination periods in vaccinated patients (n = 18), and between first and second halves of the disease's course in unvaccinated patients (n = 14). <b>Results:</b> A reduction in the frequency of surgical interventions post-vaccination (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) could be seen. The cumulated Derkay score per year decreased after second and third vaccination (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The decision to be vaccinated is influenced by multiple factors (e.g., potential side-effects, sociocultural factors, impact of social media, pre-existing conditions and the wider context of the recent pandemic). <b>Conclusions:</b> Gardasil<sup>&#xae;</sup> appears to reduce the frequency of surgery and lessen disease severity in RRP patients, supporting the potential role of HPV vaccination as a therapeutic option for RRP. Moreover, it is crucial to overcome skepticism towards vaccinations to prevent the development of HPV-associated diseases in the first place.\n",

            "Ilh&#xe9;us Virus (ILHV) was first detected in 1944 in Ilh&#xe9;us, state of Bahia, northeast Brazil. During cellular infection, orthoflaviviruses induce cellular changes related both to the replication process, the formation of replication complexes, and to structures resulting from cellular damage. Although more detailed data are available in the literature for other orthoflaviviruses, the relationship between ILHV, the formation of these structures, its replication cycle, and cellular changes remains unknown. One of the main objectives of this study is to characterize the primary ultrastructural changes in green monkey kidney epithelial cell lineage (Vero cell) infected with ILHV, as well as to map its replication cycle, virion structure, and genome. To achieve these objectives, Vero cell monolayers were infected with an MOI of 0.01 and collected at different times post-infection. Cell monolayers were evaluated under bright-field microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Ultrastructural analyses confirmed that ILHV can induce the formation of double-membrane vesicles, convoluted membranes, and vesicular packets. These structures, like those observed in zika (ZIKV) and dengue (DENV) viruses, form replication complexes that aid ILHV's replication process in cells. Our preliminary results reveal that ILHV infection induces cytopathogenesis like that observed in vitro studies for other arboviruses.\n",

            "The availability of highly effective direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) that cure individuals infected with HCV has changed completely the natural history of HCV infection and chronic hepatitis C. In sustained responders to DAAs, the most common clinical-pathologic outcome has become liver disease regression, cirrhosis re-compensation, and the de-listing of transplant candidates. However, careful scrutiny of liver disease cofactors and outcome predictors in treated patients is mandatory for an appropriate personalized surveillance of the residual risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. Since successful treatment with DAAs does not confer protective immunity against HCV reinfection, an effective vaccine is critically needed to control HCV infection. Meanwhile, it is mandatory to enhance universal access to DAAs, to test asymptomatic high-risk groups who are the main source of transmission, and to screen people who inject drugs (PWID), men who have sex with men (MSM), and sex workers, and to assure safe medical procedures with the provision of disposable needle and syringes.\n",

            "Soybean vein necrosis orthotospovirus (SVNV: Tospoviridae: Orthotospovirus) is a well-recognized thrips-vectored and seed-borne virus common in the United States (U.S.), Canada, and Egypt. Pakistan started the commercial cultivation of soybeans in the 1970s, when some soybean cultivars were imported from the U.S. to meet the country's domestic requirement of oil, poultry, animal feed, and forage. A survey of farmers and scientists was conducted in the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces of Pakistan to understand perceptions of SVNV in the indigenous Pakistani community. Concurrently, soybean fields were sampled for SVNV presence at the National Agricultural Research Institute in Islamabad, Pakistan. Based upon survey and SVNV detection results through ELISA and qRT-PCR, a policy was developed. Overall, we found that SVNV was present in Islamabad, Pakistan in USDA-approved soybean cultivars. Although scientists knew about general thrips biology and insecticides, knowledge about identification of vectors (Thrips species) was not significantly different between the scientists and the farmers. Scientists at the Islamabad location were more aware of crop production technology and pests. This study reports that Pakistan needs to strengthen its research institutes, scientists' and farmers' capacity building, and extension programs to understand the disease complex in soybean crops.\n",

            "(1) Background: We aimed to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Longyou County and to provide a basis for the future response to this disease. (2) Methods: Data on hemorrhagic fever and host animals were collected from 2011 to 2023. Descriptive methods were used to analyze the epidemic. The R4.4.1 software was used to show how the host density relates to the virus levels, temperature, and rainfall and to predict the host density. (3) Results: We observed 58 cases of hemorrhagic fever, the majority of which occurred in farmers. There were two incidence peaks each year during the spring and winter seasons, accounting for 22.41% and 43.10% of the total cases, respectively. The outdoor rodent population density was significantly and positively correlated with the outdoor rodent virus prevalence (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9411), serving as a robust predictor of the outdoor rodent virus prevalence. Additionally, the density of outdoor rodents exhibited a strong nonlinear relationship with the temperature and precipitation. (4) Conclusions: After hemorrhagic fever vaccination, rodent population density control, and rodent carrier rodent control from 1995 to 2000, the hemorrhagic fever epidemic was generally stable, and the epidemiological characteristics remained stable. In the future, we should continue to take active and effective comprehensive measures to intervene, further realize the effective control of HFRS, and prevent the recurrence of hemorrhagic fever epidemics.\n",

            "In late 2021, Eurasian-lineage highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) viruses from HA clade 2.3.4.4b were first detected in the United States. These viruses have caused severe morbidity and mortality in poultry and have been detected in numerous wild and domestic animals, including cows and humans. Notably, infected cows transmitted the virus to cats, causing extreme pathogenicity and death. While human-to-human spread of the virus has not been recorded, efficient transmission of the bovine-origin virus has also led to extreme pathogenicity and death in ferret models. Recently, markers in PB2 (E627K) and HA (E186D, Q222H), indicating mammalian adaptation mutations, were detected in an H5N1-infected patient manifesting critical illness in Canada. These, combined with instances of interspecies spread of the virus, have raised global public health concerns. This could highlight the potential for the virus to successfully adapt to mammals, posing a serious risk of a global outbreak. A One Health approach is, thereby, necessary to monitor and control the outbreak. This review aims to analyze the epidemiology, transmission, and ecological impacts of HPAI A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b in the U.S., identify knowledge gaps, and inform strategies for effective outbreak management and mitigation.\n",

            "African swine fever (ASF) is an acute and highly contagious disease that has caused great losses in the past years. It is caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV), which is a large DNA virus encoding about 165 genes. It has been shown that the purified extracellular ASFV is internalized by both constitutive macropinocytosis and clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and the virus utilizes apoptotic bodies for infection and cell cell transmission. The ASFV-encoded RNA polymerase subunit C315R is thought to play an important role in ASFV replication and transcription. However, its involvement in ASFV infection, particularly in host response, remains only partially understood. In this study, the role of C315R in enhancing ASFV replication was investigated through RNA-Seq transcriptomic analysis, which was based on 3D4/21 cells transfected the plasmid expressing HA-tagged C315R or the empty vector. Our findings revealed that C315R significantly upregulates the expression of inflammatory mediators with a particular emphasis on IL-6. The most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were predominantly associated with the TNF, IL-17, MAPK, and JAK STAT signaling pathways. RNA-seq results were validated through RT-PCR. Subsequently, we observed that ASFV infection increases IL-6 expression and STAT3 phosphorylation, which is regulated by the ASFV C315R protein. Notably, inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation with specific inhibitors suppressed ASFV replication. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the ASFV C315R protein actives STAT3 phosphorylation through promoting the transcription of IL-6 to facilitate virus replication. These findings highlight C315R as a positive regulator in the IL-6 STAT3 signaling axis during ASFV infection.\n",

            "The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the interest in the use of wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) strategy for infectious disease monitoring, especially when clinical cases are underreported. The excretion of monkey virus (MPXV) in the feces of both symptomatic and preclinical individuals has further driven the interest in WBS applicability to MPXV monitoring in wastewater to support its mitigation efforts. We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis, using six databases to assess MPXV detection in wastewater. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence at a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Also, we carried out a subgroup analysis according to the country regions and a sensitivity analysis excluding studies classified as having a high risk of bias. The overall MPXV positivity rate in wastewater was estimated at 22% (95% CI: 14-30%; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 94.8%), with more detection rate in North America (26%, 95% CI: 8-43%) compared to Europe and Asia (22%, 95% CI: 12-31%). The MPXV detection rate was significantly higher in 2022 studies (22%, 95% CI: 13-31%) compared to 2023 (19%, 95% CI: 14-25%). The real-time PCR platform significantly detected more MPXV (24%, 95% CI: 14-34%) than the digital droplet PCR-based studies (17%, 95% CI: 4-31%), which was used less frequently. Viral concentration with centrifugation procedure indicated higher detection rates (21%, 95% CI: 10-33%) than other known sample concentration protocols. Generally, MPXV detection rates in wastewater samples strongly correlate with incidence cases of mpox (range of R = 0.78-0.94; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Findings from this study suggest that WBS of MPXV could be employed as an epidemiological early warning tool for disease monitoring and mpox outbreak prediction similar to the clinical case-based surveillance strategies.\n",

            "Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 (HPAI H5N1) was first detected in chickens in Scottland in 1959 and has since circulated globally, causing regular outbreaks among different animal species, as well as incidental infections in humans. In this scoping review, the epidemiology and impact of HPAI H5N1 among migratory birds, poultry, and cattle in the United States were analyzed, with a particular focus on outbreaks since January 2022. Following PRISMA guidelines, a total of 27 articles were identified for this review. Publicly available data and reports from the USDA and CDC were also evaluated and summarized. The identified articles primarily included epidemiological studies of detections in wild birds, mammals, and case reports on H5N1 and transmission dynamics among cattle, with a notable absence of poultry-focused reports. Wild birds, especially migratory species, have played an important role in virus dissemination. Studies among mammals, including seals, bears, and domestic cats, along with the emerging outbreak among cattle, highlight the virus's ability to adapt to diverse hosts, with the possibility of mammal-to-mammal transmission. Despite the low number of human infections, the zoonotic risk of the disease and the possibility of a human outbreak remain significant. The complexity and risks associated with the virus, in comparison with the limited current scientific studies in the United States, demand further investigations to mitigate its impact on animals, ecosystems, and human health.\n",

            "Most studies analyzing data from patients who experienced at least one episode of acute COVID-19 infection have attributed the cascade of immediate and late complications to disruption of the inflammatory system and neutrophil activity in particular. Among the various functions of neutrophils is the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-6 (IL-6). Oxidative stress induced by pro-inflammatory mediators secreted by neutrophils leads to vascular endothelial dysfunction. Neutrophil counts and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) are directly associated with COVID-19 patient survival, with higher values correlating with increased mortality. To assess endothelial dysfunction secondary to COVID-19 infection, we conducted a retrospective study involving two patient cohorts, each comprising 99 participants: one group with a history of COVID-19 infection and another without. The study aimed to demonstrate the presence of endothelial dysfunction in patients with moderate COVID-19 infection using flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery and to evaluate its correlation with key inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate-ESR, fibrinogen, NLR, IL-6). FMD values were significantly reduced (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) in post-COVID-19 patients compared to those without prior infection. ESR (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), fibrinogen (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), leukocyte count (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), and granulocyte count (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) were inversely correlated with FMD values. Among post-COVID-19 patients, all analyzed parameters demonstrated a statistically significant impact on FMD, with ESR showing the strongest effect, accounting for nearly 63% of the dependency. ANOVA testing confirmed an inverse association between NLR quartiles and FMD, as well as between IL-6 levels and FMD. In conclusion, this study highlights the presence of endothelial dysfunction in post-COVID-19 patients, as assessed by FMD, and demonstrates statistically significant inverse correlations between FMD values, IL-6 levels, and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio.\n",

            "Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a vector-borne zoonotic viral disease that causes abortion storms, fetal malformations, and neonatal mortality in livestock ruminants. In humans, RVF can lead to hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, retinitis, or blindness, and about 1% of patients die. Since there are no registered vaccines for human use, developing RVF vaccines for use in animals is crucial to protect animals and prevent the spread of the virus from infecting humans. We recently developed a live bovine herpesvirus type 1 quadruple gene-mutant vector (BoHV-1qmv) that lacks virulence and immunosuppressive properties. Further, we engineered a BoHV-1qmv-vectored subunit Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) vaccine (BoHV-1qmv Sub-RVFV) for cattle, in which a chimeric polyprotein coding for the RVFV Gc, Gn, and bovine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) proteins is fused but cleaved proteolytically in infected cells into individual membrane-anchored Gc and secreted Gn-GMCSF proteins. Calves vaccinated with the BoHV-1qmv Sub-RVFV vaccine generated moderate levels of RVFV-specific serum-neutralizing (SN) antibodies and cellular immune responses. In the current study, we repurposed the BoHV-1qmv Sub-RVFV for sheep by replacing the RVFV Gc and Gn ORF sequences codon-optimized for bovines with the corresponding ovine-codon-optimized sequences and by fusing the sheep GM-CSF ORF sequences with the Gn ORF sequence. A combined primary intranasal-plus-subcutaneous primary immunization induced a moderate level of BoHV-1 (vector)- and vaccine strain MP12-specific SN antibodies and MP-12-specific cellular immune responses. Notably, an intranasal booster vaccination after 29 days triggered a rapid (within 7 days) rise in MP-12-specific SN antibody titers. Therefore, the BoHV-1qmv-vectored subunit RVFV vaccine is safe and highly immunogenic in sheep and can potentially be an efficient subunit vaccine for sheep against RVFV.\n",

            "Parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection can affect individuals of all ages, both immunocompetent and immunocompromised. This infection is typically acute and self-limiting, most commonly resulting in rash diseases and acute febrile illness. However, its involvement in atypical manifestations such as chronic kidney disease and acute liver failure have also been reported. Diagnosis of B19V is rarely conducted in these populations, and available studies on its prevalence are limited, outdated, and do not accurately depict the current situation. This study describes and discusses retrospective investigations into the role of B19V in cases of rash diseases, acute febrile illness, anemia, occurring in the context of chronic kidney disease and HIV coinfection, and acute liver failure when no identifiable etiological agent was found, focusing on various populations in Brazil. This overview underscores the importance of recognizing the potential for severe B19V infection in all individuals, regardless of perceived immune status, as well as of considering the possibility of B19V concurrent infection, in both high-risk groups and healthy individuals to reduce the risk of serious complications and improve patient outcomes, by considering the inclusion of B19V in the routine of diagnosis and implementing management strategies. This study was limited by the absence of national surveillance data of B19V in Brazil and by the analyses that occurred retrospectively.\n",

            "Equine influenza (EI) is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the equine influenza virus (EIV), posing a significant threat to equine populations worldwide. EIV exhibits considerable antigenic variability due to its segmented genome, complicating long-term disease control efforts. Although infections are rarely fatal, EIV's high transmissibility results in widespread outbreaks, leading to substantial morbidity and considerable economic impacts on veterinary care, quarantine, and equestrian activities. The H3N8 subtype has undergone significant antigenic evolution, resulting in the emergence of distinct lineages, including Eurasian and American, with the Florida sublineage being particularly prevalent. Continuous genetic surveillance and regular updates to vaccine formulations are necessary to address antigenic drift and maintain vaccination efficacy. Additionally, rare cross-species transmissions have raised concerns regarding the zoonotic potential of EIV. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and prevention of EI, emphasizing vaccination strategies and addressing the socio-economic consequences of the disease in regions where the equine industry is vital.\n",

            "Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major cause of respiratory infections worldwide. Current preventive measures, though effective for decades, face limitations due to the continuous evolution of viral strains and challenges in targeting specific viral proteins. In this study, we conducted in vivo screenings to evaluate the antiviral properties of various promising polymers to overcome the limitations of current virus infection prevention strategies. Subsequently, we performed detailed physiological and pathological assessments over an extended infection period. In the animal experiments regarding weight loss, a key symptom of viral infection, the group treated with xanthan gum (XG) showed significant suppression of weight loss compared to the untreated group starting from 3 DPI. Throughout the experiment, the treated group maintained a body weight similar to that of the uninfected group. In the virus titration and lung tissue pathology analysis, the group treated with the test substance showed a significantly lower viral load and tissue pathology results closer to normal compared to the untreated group. Additionally, we conducted in vitro combination treatment experiments to evaluate the antiviral ability of XG in conjunction with camostat, a previously known TMPRSS2 inhibitor. The results demonstrated that in the combination-treated groups, XG and camostat exhibited significantly higher cell viability at lower concentrations compared to the single-treatment groups for influenza A H1N1, A H3N2, and B type. These results indicate that XG possesses potential capabilities in inhibiting respiratory viruses and may be utilized in conjunction with existing antiviral treatments.\n",

            "Infection with the turkey hemorrhagic enteritis virus (THEV) can cause hemorrhagic enteritis, which affects young turkeys. This disease is characterized by bloody diarrhea and immunosuppression (IMS), which is attributed to apoptosis of infected B cells. Secondary infections due to IMS exacerbate economic losses. We performed the first transcriptomic analysis of a THEV infection to elucidate the mechanisms mediating THEV-induced IMS. After infecting and sequencing mRNAs of a turkey B-cell line, trimmed reads were mapped to the host turkey genome, and gene expression was quantified with StringTie. Differential gene expression analysis was followed by functional enrichment analyses using gprofiler2 and DAVID from NCBI. RT-qPCR of select genes was performed to validate the RNA-seq data. A total of 2343 and 3295 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at 12 hpi and 24 hpi, respectively. The DEGs correlated with multiple biological processes including apoptosis, ER unfolded protein response, and cell maintenance. Multiple pro-apoptotic genes, including APAF1, BMF, BAK1, and FAS were upregulated. Genes that play a role in ER stress-induced unfolded protein response including VCP, UFD1, EDEM1, and ATF4 were also upregulated and may contribute to apoptosis. Our data suggest that several biological processes and pathways including apoptosis and ER response to stress are important aspects of the host cell response to THEV infection. It is possible that interplay between multiple processes may mediate apoptosis of infected B-cells, leading to IMS.\n",

            "The production of viable nucleopolyhedrovirus in the feces of infected lepidopteran larvae represents a poorly understood route for virus transmission prior to host death. In the present study, we examined the presence of viable virus in the feces of fourth-instar <i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i> larvae infected with the Nicaraguan isolate of Spodoptera frugiperda multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (SfMNPV-NIC). Feces production increased in samples taken at 2 to 6 days post-inoculation but was significantly lower in infected insects compared to controls. Second instars experienced 3.9 to 68.3% of polyhedrosis disease following consumption of feces collected at 2-5 days post-inoculation, which subsequently fell to 29.1% in the 6-day sample. Calibration of the insect bioassay using OB-spiked samples of feces indicated that the concentration of OBs varied between 5.4 &#xd7; 10<sup>2</sup> and 4.4 &#xd7; 10<sup>5</sup> OBs/100 mg of feces in infected fourth instars. Quantitative PCR analysis of fecal samples indicated the presence of 0 to 7629 copies/mg feces following amplification targeted at the polyhedrin gene. However, no correlation was detected between qPCR estimates of virus concentration and time of sample collection or the quantity of feces collected. The qPCR estimates were positively correlated with the prevalence of lethal infection observed in the insect bioassay, but the correlation was weak and several samples did not amplify. Calibration of the qPCR assay using OB-spiked samples of feces provided estimates that were 5- to 10-fold lower than the insect bioassay, indicating inhibition of the amplification reaction or loss of material during processing. In a greenhouse experiment, 2.5-48.3% of second-instar larvae acquired lethal infection following a 24 h period of feeding on maize plants on which fourth instar larvae had deposited their feces at 3 days and 4 days post-infection, respectively. These findings highlight the potential of OB-contaminated feces as a source of biologically significant quantities of inoculum for virus transmission prior to the death of infected insects and represent an additional contribution to the biological control of lepidopteran pests by these pathogens.\n",

Here, the onset of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a more serious form of COVID-19, was predicted in a pediatric population using a set of multivariate immunological biomarker expression values. A first-stage bivariate detection of statistically significant biomarkers was obtained from a chosen set of standard cytokines and chemokine biomarkers considered relevant to COVID-19-related infection and disease. To incorporate the observed correlation structure among the resulting set of significant biomarkers, dimension reduction was then applied in the form of principal components. A second-stage logistic regression model using a small number of the principal component variables provided a highly predictive classification model for MIS-C.

            "Among begomovirus species, tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) is significant and stands out as a mechanically transmissible bipartite begomovirus originating from the Old World. However, the mechanisms underlying the mechanical transmission of different ToLCNDV strains remain understudied, as their natural transmission occurs via insect vectors. In this study, we investigated the mechanical transmissibility of two ToLCNDVs, one from Italy and another from Pakistan, in host plants. Several cucurbit species were screened, and symptom differences between the two ToLCNDV clones were observed only in zucchini when subjected to rubbing inoculation. The Italian isolate (ToLCNDV-ES) induced typical disease symptoms such as leaf curling, yellow mosaic, and internode stunting, whereas a normal phenotype was observed in zucchini mechanically infected with ToLCNDV-In (Pakistani isolate). Subsequently, a gene-swapping experiment between the two ToLCNDVs was conducted, and ToLCNDV-ES DNA-B was identified as a crucial factor in mechanical transmission. We then constructed chimeric mutant clones based on the DNA-B sequence and assessed their ability to induce symptoms in zucchini. These results indicated that the nuclear shuttle protein is a determinant of symptom development during ToLCNDV mechanical transmission. Moreover, several defense-related host genes showed significant changes in relative expression in different ToLCNDV clones, indicating their potential role in disease symptom development through the mechanical transmission of ToLCNDV. This is the first report comparing the mechanical transmissibility of two isolates of different ToLCNDV strains from the Mediterranean region and the Indian subcontinent in the same host plant, providing new insights into the virus's pathogenicity across different geographic regions.\n",

A total of 189 samples (116 blood, 26 tissue, 47 nasal swabs) were collected from MP during 2022-2023. Molecular detection was performed using conventional PCR targeting the P32 and fusion genes, while seroprevalence was assessed using an indirect ELISA kit on 184 serum samples collected from MP and Telangana between 2022 and 2024. Tissue samples showed a higher positivity rate (69.23%) for the P32 gene, while nasal swabs had a 6.38% positivity rate. The fusion gene was detected in 77.77% of tissue and 66.66% of nasal swab samples. The seroprevalence study revealed that 19.56% of serum samples were positive, with a higher prevalence of 86.11% in MP. Biochemical analysis indicated elevated levels of SGPT, SGOT, BUN, creatinine, albumin, globulin and the A/G ratio in LSDV-infected cattle, though these differences were not statistically significant. The study emphasizes that blood samples are not ideal for LSDV detection and the timing of serum sample collection plays a critical role in seroprevalence studies.\n",

            "Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is an emerging pathogen that initially causes flu-like symptoms and can progress to central nervous system (CNS) infections. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is an endemic disease in southern coastal counties with regular human cases, while the causative agent, TBEV, is prevalent in ticks in most of the coastal regions of Norway. This study was aimed to understand TBEV infection status across Norway including both TBE endemic and non-endemic areas. For this, we analyzed a total of 1940 residual serum samples from 19 counties of Norway (as of 2016). The samples were initially screened by ELISA, followed by virus neutralization tests for TBEV confirmation. We found a similar TBEV seroprevalence of 1.7% in TBE endemic and 1.6% in non-endemic areas. Since TBE cases are only reported from endemic regions, our findings suggest a potential subclinical or asymptomatic infection and underdiagnosis in non-endemic areas. Notably, only 43% of the ELISA-positive samples were confirmed by virus neutralization tests indicating that not all ELISA positives are true TBEV infections. Additionally, 137 samples of patients presenting with symptoms of CNS infections from a non-endemic area were included. Of these samples, 11 ELISA-positive samples were analyzed for cross-reactivity among flaviviruses. Cross-reactivity was detected with Dengue virus, West Nile Virus, and non-specific reactions. This underscores the importance of using multiple diagnostic tests to confirm TBEV infections. None of the patients with CNS infection was found to be TBE positive, and in the whole cohort, we found a low TBEV seroprevalence of 0.7%.\n",

            "The highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) has caused huge economic losses to the pig industry in China. This study evaluated the damage to peripheral immune tissues in the early infection of HP-PRRSV, including the hilar lymph nodes, mandibulares lymph nodes, inguinales superficials lymph nodes, spleens, and tonsils. HP-PRRSV infection led to a reduction in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, as well as CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells, in the tonsils. Additionally, CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophages and CD56<sup>+</sup> NK cells increased in all peripheral lymphoid organs, with NK cells migrating toward the lymphoid follicles. However, no significant changes were observed in CD11c<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells. RNA-seq analysis showed the down-regulation of T and B cell functions, while macrophage and NK cell functions were enhanced. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis indicated the up-regulation of necroptosis processes. Western blotting and immunofluorescence confirmed that HP-PRRSV induced PKR-mediated necroptosis in immunocytes. This study provides new insights into the effects of early HP-PRRSV infection on peripheral immune organs, highlighting dynamic shifts in immune cell populations, virus-induced immunosuppression, and the role of PKR-mediated necroptosis. These findings improve our understanding of the immunomodulation induced by PRRSV infection.\n",

            "Since 2022, three cases of human infections of novel H3N8 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have been confirmed in China. Given the potential for significant public health implications, the prompt detection and containment of the virus is particularly important. Comprehensive analyses were conducted of the complete viral gene sequences of five H3 subtype AIVs that were isolated from chickens, pigeons, and geese in live poultry markets in China in 2023. Four strains exhibited a high degree of homology with the H3N8 viruses responsible for human infections in 2022 and 2023. A subsequent study was conducted to investigate the pathogenicity differences among multiple subtypes of the H3 AIVs in chickens. The study revealed that all infected chickens exhibited clinical signs and viral shedding. Notably, two H3N8 viruses, which were highly homologous to human strains, demonstrated significant differences in adaptability to chickens. The goose-derived H3N5 strain displayed high adaptability to chickens and could replicate in multiple organs, with the highest titer in the cloaca. Additionally, a potential vaccine strain, designated CK/NT308/H3N3, was successfully developed that provided complete clinical protection and effectively prevented viral shedding against both H3N3 and H3N8 viruses. In conclusion, CK/NT308/H3N3 presents a promising vaccine candidate.\n",

            "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an important global public health issue. The World Health Organization (WHO) 2024 Global Hepatitis Report estimated that the global prevalence of people living with HBV infection is 254 million, with an estimated prevalence incidence of 1.2 million new HBV infections yearly. Previous studies have shown that natural compounds have antiviral inhibition potentials. In silico methods such as molecular docking, virtual screening, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), and molecular dynamic simulations have been successfully applied in identifying bioactive compounds with strong binding energies in HBV treatment targets. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the importance of repurposing already approved drugs using in silico methods. This study is aimed at unveiling the benefits of in silico techniques as a potential alternative in natural compounds' drug discovery and repurposing for HBV therapy. Relevant articles from PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science were retrieved and analyzed. Furthermore, this study comprehensively reviewed the literature containing identified bioactive compounds with strong inhibition of essential HBV proteins. Notably, hesperidin, quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, and flavonoids have shown strong binding energies for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The investigation reveals that in silico drug discovery methods offer an understanding of the mechanisms of action, reveal previously overlooked viral targets (including PreS1 Domain of HBsAg and cccDNA (Covalently Closed Circular DNA) regulators, and facilitate the creation of specific inhibitors. The integration of in silico, in vitro, and in vivo techniques is essential for the discovery of new drugs for HBV therapy. The insights further highlight the importance of natural compounds and in silico methods as targets in drug discovery for HBV therapy. Moreover, the combination of natural compounds, an in silico approach, and drug repurposing improves the chances of personalized and precision medicine in HBV treatment. Therefore, we recommend drug repurposing strategies that combine in vitro, in vivo, and in silico approaches to facilitate the discovery of effective HBV drugs.\n",

            "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a long history and is known for its anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immunoregulatory qualities. It has been extensively studied during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, to evaluate the relationship between TCM and the treatment of COVID-19, we conducted a meta-analysis. <b>Methods</b>: Our meta-analysis included 22 randomized clinical trials, which investigated the analyzed endpoints: time to recovery from fever, severity of dyspnea or breathlessness according on different scales, time to recovery for coughing, including dry and wet coughing, time to recovery for fatigue, changes in respiratory rate, length of hospitalization, hospital discharging rate, number of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, number of cases requiring any supplemental oxygenation, number of deaths among COVID-19 patients, conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 tests on a particular day, and time to viral assay conversion. The relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and the mean difference or standardized mean difference with 95% CIs were calculated to compare the effect. A random effects model was used to calculate effect sizes. <b>Results</b>: We indicated a positive effect of TCM on different COVID-19 symptoms. TCM influences hospitalization duration, ICU admission, mortality, and time to viral assay conversion among COVID-19 patients. Moreover, TCM positively affects SARS-CoV-2 test conversion rates on particular days (RR = 1.21; 95% CI [1.10; 1.32]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001; I<sup>2</sup> = 84%). <b>Conclusions</b>: TCM may potentially support the standard treatment of COVID-19.

            "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the etiological agent of a wide spectrum of diseases, from benign lesions to neoplasms. In most cases, in the first few years after infection, viral clearance occurs; however, in some cases, the infection remains persistent, allowing the progression of the lesions. The host immune response plays a key role in the resolution of the infection. The immune response to HPV is regulated by the dynamic interaction between numerous interleukins that exert pro- or anti-inflammatory effects. The role of interleukins in malignant lesions caused by HPV has been intensively studied, but in the case of benign lesions including warts, data are limited. This review compiles data from the last 10 years on the involvement of interleukins in the pathogenesis of warts, with the aim of providing new perspectives on this topic. Elucidating the role of interleukins will not only increase our knowledge of the pathogenesis of HPV infection but will also provide the foundation for the development of new therapies.\n",

            "<b>Background:</b> Acute pharyngitis is one of the most prevalent disorders seen in general practitioners' consultations. Most cases of acute pharyngitis in adults are caused by respiratory viruses and are self-limited. However, clinical manifestations of viral pharyngitis can overlap with bacterial pharyngitis, mainly caused by group A <i>Streptococcus</i> (GAS). A rapid antigen test for GAS can help diagnose streptococcal pharyngitis, but misdiagnosing <i>S. pyogenes</i> infection in a patient with a viral condition can lead to inappropriate antibiotic use. Some patients with a sore throat due to a virus or other causes will test positive for GAS because of carriage. The aim of our study was to analyze rapid strep test results in healthy adults. <b>Methods:</b> A cohort study was conducted in an outpatient clinic in Wroclaw. We used the rapid strep test <i>BIOSYNEX STREP A</i>. <b>Results:</b> A total of 350 healthy volunteers (&#x2265;18 years old) were enrolled in this study. The presence of <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>, based on a rapid strep test, was detected in 17 adults (4.9%). The strep test positivity rate was higher in younger adults. <b>Conclusions:</b> In healthy individuals in Poland, the prevalence of pharyngeal carriage of GAS is 4.9%. This finding emphasizes that the rapid antigen detection test should only be used in cases of suspected bacterial pharyngitis to avoid inappropriate antibiotic use.\n",

            "The Minute Virus of Canines (MVC), belonging to the genus <i>Bocaparvovirus</i> within the family <i>Parvoviridae</i>, is associated with enteritis and embryonic infection in neonatal canines. Viral attachment to host cells is a critical step in infection, and viral protein 2 (VP2) as an important structural protein of MVC influences host selection and infection severity. Nevertheless, little is known about the interaction between VP2 protein and host cells. In this study, we identified that VP2 directly interacts with the kinase domain of RhoA-associated protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) by using mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation approach and demonstrated that the RhoA/ROCK1/myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) signaling pathway was activated during the early stage of MVC infection in Walter Reed canine cell/3873D (WRD) cells. Further studies indicated that RhoA/ROCK1-mediated phosphorylation of MLC2 triggers the contraction of the actomyosin ring, disrupts tight junctions, and exposes the tight junction protein Occludin, which facilitates the interaction between VP2 and Occludin. Specific inhibitors of RhoA and ROCK1 restored the MVC-induced intracellular translocation of Occludin and the increase in cell membrane permeability. Moreover, the two inhibitors significantly reduced viral protein expression and genomic copy number. Collectively, our study provides the first evidence that there is a direct interaction between the structural protein VP2 of MVC and ROCK1, and that the tight junction protein Occludin can serve as a potential co-receptor for MVC infection, which may offer new targets for anti-MVC strategies.\n",

            "HIV testing is crucial towards the control of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) epidemic. Monitoring trends of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing over time may help interpret the incidence of new HIV diagnoses and effectiveness of HIV testing strategies. We started a research project aimed at assessing testing rates for HIV infection among Italian outpatients in 2018-2023. Numeric data for screening, confirmatory, and monitoring tests obtained by a national register were compared with the numbers of adult residents, newly diagnosed HIV infections, and patients undergoing treatment. The number of screening tests declined from 1,133,377 in 2018 to 889,972 in 2020 and increased to 1,096,822 in 2023. HIV-RNA tests showed a similar pattern, whereas confirmatory immunoblots did not vary significantly over time. The ratio of screening tests to adult residents was higher in North-West (2.87%) and North-East (2.31%) Italy compared to South Italy and the islands (1.47%), indicating that screening should be enhanced in the latter area. We observed differences between the ratio of screening tests and the incidence of newly diagnosed HIV infections by geographic area. Discrepancies in the number of screening and confirmatory tests needed for each new diagnosis suggest repeated testing on people already diagnosed and possible data reporting issues. The monitoring of HIV screening tests at the national and regional levels can provide essential data to interpret trends in HIV epidemiology and plan relevant testing strategies over time.\n",

            "Acute pharyngotonsillitis is a common reason to visit primary care providers. Group A Streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis is the most common bacterial infection which needs antibiotic treatment. GAS accounts for only 10-15% of adult acute pharyngitis cases. The overuse of antibiotics for viral pharyngotonsillitis is common and may lead to inappropriate antimicrobial stewardship and the emergence of bacterial resistance. However, the etiology of acute pharyngotonsillitis for hospitalized adult patients is rarely studied. So, we reported the 10-year surveillance data of hospitalized adult patients with acute pharyngotonsillitis in a regional hospital in Taiwan. Every consecutive adult patient admitted with acute pharyngotonsillitis in 2011-2021 was recruited for a complete etiology study. The etiology of acute pharyngotonsillitis was identified in 117 patients. Overall, 42 herpes simplex virus cases, 26 adenovirus cases, 16 acute human immunodeficiency virus cases, 12 influenza cases, three parainfluenza cases, six Epstein-Barr virus cases, one cytomegalovirus case, four enterovirus cases, one varicella-zoster virus case, four <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> cases, one <i>Chlamydophila pneumoniae</i> case, and only one GAS case were identified. The average of the points for the Modified Centor Criteria was 1.38 (55% of patients with 0-1 points and 45% with 2-3 points). However, 88.9%of patients received antibiotics at the emergency department, and 76.9%also received antibiotics while hospitalized. Only a few patients required antibiotic treatment, while the majority of patients with viral illness needed only symptomatic treatment. However, distinguishing viral etiology from GAS pharyngitis is challenging even in the presence of tonsil exudates, high C-reactive protein, and leukocytosis. A diagnostic algorithm and the application of the Modified Centor Criteria should be considered for hospitalized adults with acute pharyngotonsillitis to improve antimicrobial stewardship.\n",

            "The frequency of infectious disease outbreaks and pandemics is rising, demanding an understanding of their drivers. Common wisdom suggests that increases in outbreak frequency are driven by socioeconomic factors such as globalization and urbanization, yet, the majority of disease outbreaks are caused by zoonotic pathogens that can be transmitted from animals to humans, suggesting the important role of ecological and environmental drivers. Previous studies of outbreak drivers have also failed to quantify the differences between major classes of pathogens, such as bacterial and viral pathogens. Here, we reconsider the observed drivers of a global sample of 300 zoonotic outbreaks, including the 100 largest outbreaks that occurred between 1977 and 2017. We show that socioeconomic factors more often trigger outbreaks of bacterial pathogens, whereas ecological and environmental factors trigger viral outbreaks. However, socioeconomic factors also act as amplifiers of viral outbreaks, with higher case numbers in viral outbreaks driven by a larger proportion of socioeconomic factors. Our results demonstrate that it is useful to consider the drivers of global disease patterns in aggregate due to commonalities that cross disease systems. However, our work also identifies important differences between the driver profiles of bacterial and viral diseases in aggregate.\n",

            "Available interventions for the management of chronic hepatitis B (hepB) exhibit limited efficacy and barriers to vaccination against the hepatitis B virus (HBV) have hampered prophylaxis programmes. Development of potent therapeutics capable of functional cure of chronic hepB thus remains a relevant medical objective. RNA interference (RNAi) can be exploited to effect potent and specific silencing of target genes through the introduction of RNA sequences that mimic the natural activators of the pathway. To achieve a therapeutic effect, artificial primary microRNAs (pri-miRNAs) have been used extensively to target various viruses, including HBV. To date artificial pri-miRNAs have exclusively been produced from DNA expression cassettes. Although this achieves impressive silencing, eventual translation of this platform to the clinic is complicated by the requirement for viral vectors to deliver DNA. Consequently, clinical translation has been slow. Recently, the use of in vitro transcribed RNA, specifically to produce mRNA vaccines at industrial scale, has gained significant interest. We therefore sought to evaluate the feasibility of using in vitro transcribed artificial pri-miRNAs for the inhibition of HBV gene expression. Artificial HBV-targeting pri-miR-31 sequences, which are highly effective when expressed in cells from a DNA template, demonstrated modest silencing of viral replication when incorporated into mRNA that was transcribed in vitro. Off-target effects were also observed. Characterisation revealed that intracellular processing of the artificial pri-miRNAs was inefficient and non-specific effects were caused by stimulation of the interferon response. Nevertheless, optimised nuclear delivery of the artificial pri-miRNAs should improve their processing and achieve better anti-hepB efficacy.\n",

The viral loads in the respiratory system, including the nasal turbinate, trachea, and lung, were significantly reduced in the infected golden hamsters that received LNT treatment. Furthermore, the amount of exhaled virus aerosols in hamsters treated with LNT was significantly lower than that in untreated hamsters throughout the entire disease progression. In detail, the amounts of virus-laden particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 5 &#xb5;m exhibited a significant decreasing trend following LNT treatment. Moreover, the detection rate of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in each stage of the Anderson-6 sampler exhibited a decreasing trend following LNT treatment post-infection. In summary, our findings indicate that LNT therapy represents a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, during the course of treatment, LNT has the potential to reduce viral infectivity in affected individuals.\n",

This has been emphasized by the recent COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There is thus an unmet need to develop technologies that arrest the spread of airborne infectious diseases by inactivating viruses in the air. In this study, the efficacy of two commercially available air ionizer systems for inactivating the bacteriophage MS2, which has been utilized as a surrogate of SARS-CoV-2 as well as a surrogate of noroviruses, was assessed. An experimental test apparatus similar to an HVAC duct system was utilized for the efficacy testing. Each of the two ionizer devices was challenged with viral aerosols of the bacteriophage MS2. The results indicate that the two ionizers were able to reduce the concentration of bacteriophage MS2 virus in the air by 82.02% and 81.72%, respectively. These results point to the efficacy of these ionizer devices in inactivating airborne microorganisms and thus making them an important tool in arresting the spread of infectious diseases. More studies are needed to assess their efficacy against other important airborne viruses such as influenza and strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n",

Co-infection of mandarin fish with <i>A. hydrophila</i> and ISKNV occurs from time to time. In this study, a visual detection method for ISKNV and <i>A. hydrophila</i> was developed, using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and pre-addition of hydroxynaphthol blue. Primers for amplifying LAMP in the same system were designed based on the conserved regions of the MCP gene of infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus, as well as the <i>hlyA</i> gene of <i>A. hydrophila</i>. The results showed that this method amplified bright trapezoidal bands in the presence of only <i>A. hydrophila</i> or ISKNV and both, with sky blue for positive amplification and violet for negative amplification. There was no cross-reactivity with other pathogens, and fragments of 182 bp, 171 bp and 163 bp appeared after digestion of the <i>A. hydrophila</i> LAMP product and 136 bp, 117 bp and 96 bp appeared after digestion of the ISKNV LAMP product. This holds true even when both positive products are present simultaneously. The minimum detection limit of this method was 100 fg for <i>A. hydrophila</i> and 100 fg for ISKNV, and the minimum detection limit for the mixed template was 1 pg. Overall, this method has high sensitivity and specificity to rapidly detect and distinguish between the two pathogens.\n",

The in vitro studies demonstrate that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and as well as its targets, CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, were significantly activated by bovine coronavirus infection in bovine cells (MDBK). During infection, the pretreatment of cells with non-cytotoxic doses of CH223191, a selective inhibitor of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, resulted in a significant reduction in virus yield and a downregulation in the viral spike protein expression. These findings occurred in the presence of the inhibition of aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling. Our results reveal that the bovine coronavirus acts on viral replication, upregulating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and its downstream target proteins, CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. In addition, following the in silico studies, the three-dimensional structural model of the bovine aryl hydrocarbon receptor in complex with the antagonist CH223191 indicates that the molecular mechanism, by which the PASB and TAD domains of the receptor interact with the inhibitor, is mainly driven by an extensive network of hydrophobic interactions, with a series of hydrogen bonds contributing to stabilizing the complex. Interestingly, bioinformatic analyses revealed that the PASB and TAD domains in the human and bovine aryl hydrocarbon receptor present high similarity at the primary sequence and three-dimensional structure levels. Taken together, these findings represent a fundamental step for the development of innovative drugs targeting AhR as a potential object for CoVs therapy.\n",

            "Lower respiratory infections, mostly caused by viral or bacterial pathogens, remain a leading global cause of mortality. The differences between animal models and humans contribute to inefficiencies in drug development, highlighting the need for more relevant and predictive, non-animal models. In this context, AlveolAir&#x2122;, a fully primary in vitro 3D human alveolar model, was characterized and demonstrated the sustained presence of alveolar type I (ATI) and type II (ATII) cells. This model exhibited a functional barrier over a 30-day period, evidenced by high transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). These findings were further validated by tight junctions' confocal microscopy and low permeability to Lucifer yellow, confirming AlveolAir&#x2122; as robust platform for drug transport assays. Additionally, successful infections with H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses were achieved, and antiviral treatments with Baloxavir and Remdesivir, respectively, effectively reduced viral replication. Interestingly, both viruses infected only the epithelial layer without replicating in endothelial cells. These findings indicate AlveolAir&#x2122; as a relevant model for assessing the toxicity and permeability of xenobiotics and evaluating the efficacy of novel antiviral therapies.\n",

            "Autochthonous dengue cases have been continuously recorded in Europe in the past two decades. The first autochthonous dengue case in Croatia was reported in 2010 on the Pelje&#x161;ac Peninsula, while imported cases were recorded continuously thereafter. In 2024, dengue re-emerged in Croatia. An epidemiological and entomological study was conducted after receiving information on dengue virus (DENV) infection in a German tourist probably acquired on Dugi Otok Island in Croatia in May 2024. Serum samples were collected from 30 residents of the Veli Rat region where the patient had stayed. In addition, mosquitoes were collected in the same area. Human samples were tested for the presence of DENV antibodies (ELISA and IFA) and DENV RNA (RT-qPCR), while mosquito samples were tested for DENV RNA (RT-qPCR). DENV IgM or IgG antibodies were found in 8 serum samples, while no one sample was RT-qPCR positive. No cross-reactivity with flaviviruses was detected in seropositive samples, supporting DENV infection. One patient was classified as a confirmed dengue case (IgG seroconversion in paired serum samples) and five as probable cases (IgM detection in a single serum sample). One additional patient, sampled only once, was IgG seropositive. Two of the seropositive individuals reported fever and rash three weeks before testing. The re-emergence of dengue in Croatia highlights the need for continuous monitoring of DENV circulation in both humans and vectors.\n",

            "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, profoundly impacted global health systems and economies. Vaccination and diagnostic advancements were pivotal in managing the pandemic. This systematic review evaluates antibody levels in adults following complete COVID-19 vaccination and examines the prevalence of infections in vaccinated populations. A systematic review adhering to PRISMA guidelines was conducted, focusing on studies analyzing antibody levels at least 14 days after full vaccination with FDA- or EMA-approved vaccines. Five European studies meeting the inclusion criteria were selected. Data were extracted and synthesized from studies involving 6280 participants aged 19 to 105, with an average of 11% having prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Antibody levels were analyzed over time, and the incidence of post-vaccination COVID-19 cases was recorded. The reviewed studies demonstrated that antibody levels peaked shortly after vaccination but gradually declined over time. Individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited higher antibody titers than those without prior exposure. After the first dose, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine led to significantly higher antibody levels than the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, especially in those without prior infection. Across all studies, the incidence of COVID-19 among vaccinated individuals was low (0.1-3.8% for 144-302 days post-vaccination). Vaccination reduced severe outcomes despite decreasing antibody levels. The decline in new COVID-19 cases and related deaths is attributed to widespread vaccination, natural immunity, and virus mutations reducing severity. Further studies are warranted to explore antibody persistence and optimal vaccination strategies.\n",

            "Porcine viral diarrhea has always been one of the main obstacles to the healthy development of the pig industry in China with its variety of pathogens and complexity of co-infections. Analysis of the dominant mixed-infection model is a fundamental step in boosting the prevention and control of porcine diarrhea. In this study, 3256 porcine fecal samples were collected from 17 pig herds in Shanghai, China, from 2015 to 2023 to identify novel pathogenic infection patterns. The results confirmed that porcine astrovirus (PAstV), porcine sapelovirus (PSV), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) were the top three agents with positive rates of 28.47%, 20.71%, and 20.23%, respectively. Porcine rotavirus (PoRV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) accounted for only 8.12% and 1.12%, respectively. Importantly, mixed infection rates were high and complicated. The double infection rate was higher than that of a single infection. Next, the mixed-infection model of PEDV and emerging diarrheal pathogens was explored. The predominant dual-infection models were PEDV/PKoV (porcine kobuvirus) (14.18%), PEDV/PAstV (10.02%), and PEDV/PSV (9.29%). The predominant triple infection models were PEDV/PKoV/PAstV (18.93%), PEDV/PSV/PAstV (10.65%), and PEDV/PKoV/PSV (7.10%). The dominant quadruple-infection model was PEDV/PAstV/PSV/PKoV (46.82%). In conclusion, PEDV is mainly mix-infected with PAstV, PSV, and PKoV in clinical settings. Furthermore, multiple-factor logistic regression analysis confirmed that PAstV, PKoV, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and PEDV were closely related to porcine diarrhea. PEDV/PKoV, PEDV/porcine sapovirus (PoSaV), PKoV/BVDV, PoSaV/BVDV, and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV)/PoSaV had great co-infection dominance, which will be helpful for porcine co-infection research.\n",

            "Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a re-emerging viral transboundary disease affecting cattle and buffaloes, resulting in a significant socio-economic impact on the affected regions. LSD is primarily transmitted among susceptible livestock through hematophagous vectors, including ticks and flies. Ticks also function as reservoirs for various haemoprotozoan parasites, increasing the likelihood of coinfections in affected animals. This study investigates the comorbidity of LSD and associated risk factors using diverse datasets. A total of 414 samples from LSD-suspected animals were screened for LSD, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), babesiosis, and theileriosis (<i>Theileria annulata</i> and <i>Theileria orientalis</i>), as well as anaplasmosis. Among these, 214 (51.6%) tested positive for LSD. A strong correlation was identified between LSD and oriental theileriosis caused by <i>Theileria orientalis</i> (50.9%). Other significant associations were observed with IBR (34.1%), anaplasmosis (24.7%), tropical theileriosis (15.4%), babesiosis (12.6%), and MCF (12.1%). The transmission dynamics of LSD revealed that hematophagous vectors, particularly <i>Stomoxys</i>, <i>Haematobia</i>, and <i>Rhipicephalus</i>, play a crucial role in its spread, especially in unorganised farming systems. Additionally, <i>Haematobia</i> and <i>Stomoxys</i> flies were implicated in the high transmission rate of oriental theileriosis (39%) in conjunction with LSD. Notably, ticks (<i>Rhipicephalus</i>) facilitated the concurrent transmission of one, two, or three infections alongside LSD. While Musca, a non-hematophagous fly, was found to carry LSD virus (LSDV), it did not test positive for other pathogens. This study highlights the potential for cattle to harbour multiple diseases simultaneously with LSD, emphasising the necessity for integrated transmission studies and comprehensive disease screening in affected livestock. These findings underscore the importance of implementing targeted prevention and control strategies to mitigate disease impact in livestock populations.\n",

            "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has reshaped the epidemiological landscape of respiratory diseases, with profound implications for seasonal influenza. Nonpharmaceutical interventions implemented globally during the pandemic significantly altered human behavior and reduced the prevalence of respiratory pathogens, including influenza. However, the post-pandemic resurgence of influenza activity to pre-pandemic levels highlights the persistent challenges posed by this virus. During the 2023-2024 influenza season in the United States, an estimated 40 million individuals contracted influenza, resulting in 470,000 hospitalizations and 28,000 deaths, with the elderly disproportionately affected. Pediatric mortality was also notable, with 724 deaths reported among children. This study examines trends in influenza incidence, vaccination rates, and mortality in the United States from the 2018-2019 through to the 2023-2024 influenza seasons. Additionally, it evaluates the interplay between influenza and SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic, considering the impact of disrupted air travel, public health measures, and altered virus circulation dynamics. By integrating these insights, the study underscores the critical need for sustained vaccination campaigns and innovative public health strategies to mitigate the dual burden of respiratory diseases. Findings from this analysis highlight the urgency of strengthening prevention and surveillance systems to enhance pandemic preparedness and reduce the impact of respiratory pathogens in an evolving epidemiological landscape.\n",

            "<i>Background/Objectives</i>: Effective HIV treatment and prevention rely heavily on patient adherence to the prescribed regimen. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), which involves measuring medication concentrations in blood circulation, offers an objective method to evaluate toxic or ineffective drug levels. TDM is not routinely used in HIV treatment in clinical practice. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to survey infectious disease providers' attitudes and barriers toward therapeutic drug monitoring for antiretroviral therapy in people living with HIV. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: A 15-item online survey was distributed to infectious disease providers in the Greater Houston area, including physicians, pharmacists, and mid-level practitioners involved in HIV patient care. The survey was disseminated via the Houston Citywide Infectious Disease Provider Network and the Houston AIDS Education and Training Center. The survey employed close-ended questions to evaluate providers' attitudes, perceptions, practices, and barriers toward antiretroviral drug level monitoring. Responses were recorded using a five-point Likert scale. Demographic characteristics and information regarding research involvement were collected to contextualize the findings. The survey results were analyzed using descriptive statistics, with categorical variables expressed as frequencies and percentages using SAS software. <i>Results</i>: A total of 139 responses were received, with 89 participants meeting the inclusion criteria; the majority were female (62.9%), nearly half were aged 34 or younger (53.4%), 50% were physicians and 36.3% pharmacists, and most worked in hospitals (52.3%) or clinics (35.2%). The findings demonstrate participants' predominantly positive attitudes toward TDM. Nearly 70% agree (agree or strongly agree) that TDM will be helpful and will positively impact improving drug efficacy and medication adherence. The results revealed barriers to implementing TDM, including a lack of evidence supporting TDM's impact on HIV outcomes, and the absence of clinical guidelines. The results indicated that &gt;90% were ambivalent or agreed that there was not enough evidence to support the use of TDM, and nearly all recognized that the guidelines do not endorse it or did not know if they do not endorse it. <i>Conclusions</i>: This study highlighted positive attitudes and significant barriers to implementing therapeutic drug monitoring, including a lack of evidence supporting TDM's impact on HIV outcomes and the absence of clinical guidelines supporting TDM's widespread use. The findings emphasize the need for clinical trials and longitudinal studies to establish definitive evidence on the effectiveness of TDM in improving HIV treatment outcomes.\n",

            "<i>Background and Objective:</i> Irrational use and overuse of antibiotics is considered a major cause of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among patients admitted to hospitals, especially in intensive care units (ICUs). ICUs are the most critical wards in healthcare settings, where the use of antibiotics is much higher compared to other wards. Therefore, the appropriate administration and monitoring of antibiotic usage in these units is a matter of concern. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> This retrospective study evaluated the types, utilization patterns, sensitivity, and resistance of various antibiotics used among patients admitted to the ICUs of different hospitals after the third wave of the coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) in Pakistan. <i>Results:</i> It was observed that more than 40% of the patients were given two antibiotics and 54.3% were given at least one antibiotic each day. A total of 768 antibiotics from different groups, based on the World Health Organization (WHO) Access, Watch, and Reserve (AWaRe) classification, were prescribed to 313 patients admitted to ICUs between April and August 2021. Among the types of antibiotics, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was the most frequently used antibiotic (75 prescriptions). It was also observed that the majority of the bacterial isolates were more sensitive to carbapenems than the other antibiotics. The current study showed that antibiotic usage according to the AWaRe classifications was 31.8% in the Access category, 59.5% in the Watch category, and 8.7% in the Reserve category in ICUs of the studied hospitals after the third wave of COVID-19. <i>Conclusions:</i> The findings of the study also highlight the importance and continuous need for the implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs to optimize the appropriate utilization of antibiotics in the ICUs of the studied hospitals.\n",

            "<i>Background and Objectives</i>: The COVID-19 pandemic globally has negative effects on mental health. Research from Western countries, such as the US, Canada, Australia, and Europe, shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with an increased trend of anorexia nervosa (AN) among children and adolescents. However, the trend after the pandemic in Eastern countries, including Japan, is not well-understood, and it remains unclear whether the pandemic is associated with the trend in these countries. This study aimed to examine the association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the newly diagnosed AN among children and adolescents in Japan. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: Using the nationwide multi-hospital database in Japan, we analyzed the clinical outpatient data in the departments of pediatrics, psychosomatic medicine, and psychiatry. The participants comprised children and adolescents aged 7-19 years newly diagnosed with AN from January 2017 to January 2022. An interrupted time series analysis was used to compare the trends of newly diagnosed AN before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Estimating the changes in the trends over the pandemic was performed using a Poisson regression model. <i>Results</i>: The total cases of newly diagnosed AN were 41 cases diagnosed in 38 months (1.08 cases per month) before the pandemic and 34 in 23 months (1.48 cases per month) after the pandemic. Notably, in the 7-14 age group, the cases per month increased from 0.74 to 1.13 cases per month over the period. Before the pandemic, a decrease in cases was observed (Incidence Rate Ratio [IRR] = 0.961; 95% CI = 0.932-0.990). Conversely, the after-pandemic period showed a contrasting trend, with increased cases (IRR = 1.096; 95% CI = 1.032-1.176). Furthermore, the number and cases per month in boys increased over the period, from 1 to 5 cases and from 0.03 to 0.22 cases per month, compared to girls from 28 to 26 cases and from 1.05 to 1.26 cases per month. <i>Conclusions:</i> Our findings suggest that sociocultural differences at a national level may not affect the trend of AN after the pandemic. The pandemic and lifestyle changes after the pandemic occurred in both Western and Eastern countries. Considering that, individual, parental, and peer factors related to the pandemic and the consequent lifestyle changes may be more associated with the development of AN. Further research in different countries is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of AN and the long-term impact of the pandemic.\n",

            "<i>Background and Objectives:</i> The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic presented unprecedented challenges in balancing infection control measures with the timely management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), a time-sensitive condition. This study investigates the pandemic's effects on STEMI management times and outcomes at a high-volume medical center in Taiwan. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> A retrospective analysis of 1309 STEMI patients was conducted at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between 2017 and 2022. Patients were divided into pre-pandemic and pandemic groups. Measurement outcomes include in-hospital mortality rate, management times (e.g., door-to-balloon time), the rates of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and/or veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) usage, mechanical ventilation, inotropic support, and the length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and statistical comparisons were performed to assess temporal trends and prognostic outcomes. <i>Results:</i> No significant difference in in-hospital mortality was observed between pre-pandemic (5.85%) and pandemic (7.03%) groups (<i>p</i> = 0.45). The pandemic group experienced longer management times, including door-to-cath arrival (<i>p</i> = 0.0335) and door-to-balloon time (<i>p</i> = 0.014), although all times remained below the 90 min threshold. Quality improvements during the first outbreak allowed the institution to handle higher case volumes during subsequent waves without further delays. Ninety-day survival analysis showed no significant disparity between groups (<i>p</i> = 0.3655). <i>Conclusions:</i> Pandemic-related delays in STEMI management were effectively mitigated through workflow optimization, preventing significant increases in mortality rates. This study highlights the adaptability of healthcare systems in responding to crises while maintaining quality care for time-sensitive emergencies. Future multicenter studies could provide broader insights into global STEMI management strategies under pandemic conditions.\n",

            "<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) posed unique challenges worldwide, underscoring important gaps in healthcare preparedness for patients receiving immunosuppressive therapies, such as the individuals with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), a subgroup of spondyloarthritis (SpA) characterized by chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation. While global registry data exist for SpA, specific data on axSpA alone remain scarce, especially in Central and Eastern European populations. This study aims to identify predictive factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes and provide a descriptive analysis of axSpA patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using real-world data from the Romanian Registry of Rheumatic Diseases (RRBR). <i>Materials and Methods</i>: This is a three-year retrospective observational cohort study that included 5.786 axSpA patients from the RRBR, of whom 183 (3.16%) were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data were analyzed using R V4.4.1 and performing univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression to estimate associations using odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and <i>p</i>-values. A backward selection algorithm was applied to create the final predictive model, accounting for multicollinearity through variance inflation factors (VIFs). <i>Results</i>: The mean age of patients was 48.19 &#xb1; 12.26 years, with male predominance (64.5%). Serious COVID-19 (encompassing moderate to critical cases) occurred in 46 cases, with age &#x2265; 52.5 years (OR 2.64, 95% CI: 1.28-5.48, <i>p</i> = 0.009) and arterial hypertension (OR 2.57, 95% CI: 1.29-5.16, <i>p</i> = 0.007) identified as significant predictors. Individuals with advanced education levels had nearly three times lower odds of experiencing serious COVID-19 (OR 0.38, 95% CI: 0.18-0.76, <i>p</i> = 0.008). Furthermore, our findings confirm the lack of association between HLA-B27 and COVID-19 severity (<i>p</i> = 0.194), contributing to the ongoing discussion regarding its potential immunological role. Moreover, irrespective of the biological therapy administered, the likelihood of experiencing serious SARS-CoV-2 outcomes was not statistically significant (<i>p</i> = 0.882). In the final predictive model, only older age and higher education were deemed as predictive factors. <i>Conclusions</i>: This study highlights key predictors of COVID-19 severity in axSpA patients and emphasizes the protective role of higher education, an underexplored determinant of health outcomes in inflammatory diseases. The lessons learned during these last years can shape a more informed and compassionate healthcare system.\n",

We aimed to determine the radiological changes at 6 and 12 months after COVID-19 pneumonia, its evolution and its risk factors. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: This retrospective longitudinal study included adults admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia from 1 March 2020 to 30 April 2021 who had a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan at 6 months and 12 months after hospital discharge. The primary outcome was the appearance of radiological abnormalities on HRCT and the number of lung segments affected by them at 6 and 12 months, while the main explanatory variables were about the disease course, analytical parameters and treatment. <i>Results</i>: This study included n = 108 patients, with a mean age of 64 years.

            "Dengue Fever, a widespread mosquito-borne disease caused by the dengue virus (DENV), poses a major health threat in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, resulting in millions of infections yearly. Severe cases of dengue fever have a mortality rate of around fifteen percent. Currently, there are no antiviral treatments for this disease and the only FDA-approved vaccine has been known to have adverse effects, especially in children. Thus, there is an urgent need for new therapeutics for Dengue fever. The largest issue with developing an antiviral treatment is that DENV has four serotypes that each differ slightly enough to pose problems with one compound inhibiting all four. This study addresses that challenge to some extent by focusing on in silico screening of potential hits targeting the envelope glycoprotein, which is relatively conserved across these four serotypes. Using pharmacophore screening and in silico evaluation of ligands, we identified compounds which could potentially have high affinity to the envelope glycoprotein for two of the four DENV serotypes. These in silico results were validated experimentally using bio-layer interferometry. These findings lay a foundation for in vitro analysis and hit-to-lead studies, advancing the development of antivirals that can inhibit multiple serotypes of the dengue virus.\n",

            "The pathogenesis of COVID-19 highlights a complex relationship between disease severity and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). We aimed to investigate the relationships among the total NAb (tNAb) levels, the presence of potential neutralization antibodies (pNAbs), and the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Patients aged &#x2265;18 years diagnosed between October 2021 and September 2022 were grouped by symptom severity. Blood samples were taken at two time points and data on demographics, epidemiology, and vaccination were recorded. The tNAbs and pNAbs were measured by an enhanced chemiluminescence assay and a surrogate virus neutralization test, respectively. The tNAbs of 68 and the pNAbs of 52 patients were analyzed. Twenty-six (38.2%) patients had severe infection. The 28-day mortality rate was 16.2% (n = 11). The tNAb levels in the control blood samples (CBSs) were significantly higher than those of the admission blood samples (ABSs) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The statistical analysis showed no relationship between disease severity and pNAbs. Vaccinated patients had significantly higher tNAbs in the ABSs and CBSs (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 and <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, respectively). The presence of pNAbs in the ABSs was correlated with a lower 28-day mortality (<i>p</i> = 0.026) and a milder disease course (<i>p</i> = 0.041). Although these findings support a correlation between tNAbs and disease severity and mortality, their presence seems to be unrelated to favorable clinical outcomes.\n",

The present study demonstrates that BBM exerts strong antiviral efficacy against influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We examined the anti-IAV effect of BBM using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing influenza A and H1N1 IAV. The fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, and plaque assay showed that BBM significantly hinders IAV infection. The immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the anti-influenza activity of BBM. From the time-of-addition and hemagglutination inhibition results, it is elucidated that the antiviral effect of BBM is closely related to its inhibitory effect against viral binding and entry at an early infection stage. Our findings imply that BBM has the potential to be developed as a potent antiviral drug against influenza viral infection.\n",

            "DNA methylation is one mechanism of epigenetic regulation in plants. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeted endogenous genes and caused the promoters to be hypermethylated, namely RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Repressor of silencing 1 (ROS1) is an active DNA demethylase involved in the regulation of DNA methylation. This study indicates that ROS1-mediated DNA demethylation plays important roles in regulating the expression of these stress response genes and in response to biotic stresses. Further experiments confirmed that the expression level of the <i>ROS1</i> gene was significantly upregulated in <i>A. thaliana</i> plants infected with <i>beet severe curly top virus</i> (BSCTV). Moreover, the DNA sequencing results demonstrated that ROS1 interferes with DNA methylation of repeat regions in the promoters of <i>ACD6</i>, <i>GSTF14</i>, and <i>ACO3</i> in <i>A. thaliana</i> plants infected with BSCTV. These findings reveal the epigenetic mechanisms by which ROS1 regulates the expression of the stress response genes, thereby improving the adaptability of plants to biotic stresses.\n",

            "The persistence of latent HIV-1 proviruses in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is a major obstacle to curing HIV. The \"shock and kill\" strategy involves reversing latency with latency-reversing agents (LRAs) and selectively inducing cell death in infected cells. However, current LRAs have shown limited efficacy in eliminating the ex vivo HIV reservoir and thus failed in clinical study. In this study, we repurposed PZ703b, a pro-apoptotic protein degrader initially developed for anti-leukemia therapy, to target HIV eradication. PZ703b induced the degradation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, activating the non-canonical NF-kB pathway and caspases cascade, resulting in latency reversal and the selective apoptosis of infected cells. The treatment of ex vivo CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from ART-suppressed HIV-1 patients led to approximately a 50% reduction in the replication-competent reservoir. While this result does not reach the threshold required for a complete cure, it demonstrates the potential of a dual degrader of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL in reversing HIV latency and inducing selective cell death. Our study provides a proof-of-concept for using dual degraders of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL as a novel category of LRAs in therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing HIV reservoirs. This approach may pave the way for the further exploration of targeted interventions to eliminate the HIV-inducible reservoir.\n",

            "Much remains to be understood about COVID-19, but the protective role of antibodies (Igs) is widely accepted in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Igs' functions are mainly carried out by receptors that bind to their Fc portion (FcR), and less attention has been dedicated to the cytoplasmic members of this family. In this work, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to discern cell populations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from healthy individuals and patients with mild or severe COVID-19. Then, we evaluated the transcription of neonatal FcR (FcRn, <i>FCGRT</i> gene) and tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (<i>TRIM21</i>) and its downstream signaling components. The TRIM21 pathway is vital for virus infections as it has a dual function, leading opsonized viruses to degradation by proteasomes and the activation of innate inflammatory anti-virus response. The transcriptional level of <i>FCGRT</i> showed no statistical differences in any cell population comparing the three groups of patients. On the other hand, <i>TRIM21</i> transcription was significantly higher in myeloid cells collected from patients with mild COVID-19. When comparing mild with severe cases, there was no statistical difference in <i>TRIM21</i> transcription in lung adaptive lymphoid cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILC). Yet, we analyzed the transcription of all downstream signaling molecules in myeloid and, as most cells expressed the receptor, in adaptive lymphoid cells. Moreover, ILCs from mild cases and all cell populations from severe cases were missing most downstream components of the pathway. We observed that members of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and other components associated with TRIM21 proteasomal degradation were transcribed in mild cases. Despite the transcription of the danger sensors <i>DDX58</i> and <i>IFIH1</i>, the transcriptional level of inflammatory <i>IL1B</i> and <i>IL18</i> was generally very low, along with the <i>NLRP3</i> danger sensor, members of the NF-&#x3ba;B pathway, and <i>TNF</i>. Therefore, our data suggest that TRIM21 may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 protection by reducing the viral load, while the inflammatory branch of the pathway would be silenced, leading to no pathogenic cytokine production.\n",

            "Viral infections of the reproductive tract and testis in male yaks, often resulting from natural mating under grazing conditions, can lead to infertility due to Leydig cell (LC) apoptosis, immune activation, oxidative stress, and reduced testosterone production. Spermidine (SPD), a potential therapeutic agent with antioxidant and anti-aging properties, might alleviate oxidant stress, immune response, and virus infection caused by apoptosis. In this study, firstly testicular Leydig cells of yak were induced with Poly(I:C), the pathogen-associated molecular pattern of the dsRNA virus, as a pathogenic model at the cellular level. Secondly, immune response, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and testosterone synthesis were measured in LC with or without SPD culture medium. Finally, transcriptomic sequencing was utilized to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effects of SPD. These results suggested Poly(I:C) damaged the function of Leydig cells, significantly decreased the concentration of testosterone, and induced immune response, oxidative stress, and cell apoptosis, while SPD significantly alleviated the immune response and oxidative stress, and then significantly inhibited cell apoptosis and restores testosterone production in LCs. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that SPD significantly alleviates inflammation and apoptosis induced by Poly(I:C), reducing immune response and cellular damage through the regulation of several key gene expressions. These findings suggest SPD has the potential ability to mitigate Poly(I:C)-induced immune response, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, and then restore testosterone production in Leydig cells, offering a promising strategy to protect and enhance male yak fertility after infection with dsRNA virus.\n",

            "Common bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> L.) is known for its high protein, dietary fiber, and various trace element contents, making it a widely grown leguminous crop globally. The bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) poses a significant threat to leguminous crop production, causing substantial yield reductions when common beans are infected. Widely occurring in mRNA, the m<sup>6</sup>A modification is vital for maintaining mRNA stability, facilitating splicing, enabling nuclear export, supporting polyadenylation, and initiating translation. Recent studies have identified the m<sup>6</sup>A regulatory gene family in various plant species, and its ability to regulate plant virus infection has been confirmed. There is currently insufficient information regarding the m<sup>6</sup>A regulatory gene family in beans and how it responds to BCMV infection. Consequently, we carried out a genome-wide characterization of the m<sup>6</sup>A regulatory gene family in common bean, which led to the identification of 31 potential regulatory gene members associated with m<sup>6</sup>A. According to evolutionary analysis, the increase in the bean m<sup>6</sup>A regulatory gene family appears to be linked to either whole-genome duplication or segmental duplication events. Subsequent investigations into the expression levels of these genes throughout different phases of BCMV infection showed that all candidate genes responded to the infection with various changes in expression. Moreover, we characterized the methyltransferase activity of PvMTA and validated the interactive relationship between mRNA adenosine methyltransferase A (MTA) and mRNA adenosine methyltransferase B (MTB) in common beans. Through overexpressing and silencing <i>PvMTA</i>, we further ascertained that this particular gene has a detrimental impact on the regulation of BCMV infection. This research provides fresh perspectives on the molecular processes that govern the interaction between the common bean and BCMV and aids progress in molecular bean breeding.\n",

            "The H12 subtypes of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are globally prevalent in wild birds, occasionally spilling over into poultry. In this study, we isolated an H12N8 virus from ducks in a live poultry market. Full genomic analysis revealed that the virus bears a single basic amino acid in the cleavage site of the hemagglutinin gene. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the eight gene segments of the H12N8 virus belong to the Eurasian lineage and the HA gene was clustered with wild bird-originated H12 viruses, with its NP gene showing the highest nucleotide similarity to 2013-like H7N9 viruses. The H12N8 virus replicated effectively in both mammalian and avian cells without prior adaptation. Moreover, the H12N8 virus could infect and replicate in the upper respiratory tract of BALB/c mice without prior adaptation. The H12N8 virus replicated and transmitted inefficiently in both ducks and chickens and hardly triggered high hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers in the inoculated and contact animals. These results suggest that the wild bird-origin H12N8 virus has reassorted with viruses circulating in domestic poultry, but it inefficiently replicates and transmits in avian hosts. Our findings demonstrate that H12N8 AIV has emerged in domestic poultry, emphasizing the importance of active surveillance of AIVs in both wild and domestic birds.\n",

            "The mpox virus (MPXV) Clade IIb outbreak in 2022 was the biggest one ever to occur outside Africa, causing different types of clinical symptoms and levels of disease severity. There is no currently approved treatment for mpox, but Tecovirimat has proven effective against known orthopoxviruses in several animal models and Vero cell cultures. Since serious complications, including lung involvement, have been reported, especially in immunocompromised people, we investigated the effects of MPXV infection on the in vitro model of lung airway epithelium (Calu-3 cell line) and examined MPXV replication kinetic and related ultrastructural changes, also performing dose-response studies to measure Tecovirimat antiviral activity. Our results highlighted an active replication of MPXV in Calu-3 cells linked to mitochondrial structural modifications with perinuclear relocation and the formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles. Treatment with Tecovirimat consistently reduced viral replication both in supernatants (81%) and inside cells (77%) and ultimately stopped viral infectivity (92% of cytopathic effect reduction) after 48 h of infection. Drug administration inhibited the final wrapping of mature viral particles, causing extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation. Our results demonstrated Tecovirimat's in vitro effectiveness against MPXV at the nanomolar concentration on Calu-3 cells. This suggests a potential rationale for using this drug for patients with mpox severe disease and lung involvement.\n",

            "Most genomic studies on Epstein-Barr virus variability have focused on the geographic and pathological associations of EBV1 genomes. In contrast, the variability of EBV2 genomes has been less explored, mainly due to their restricted geographic circulation and the lesser number of sequenced EBV2 isolates. In this study, we sequenced and analyzed twenty-eight EBV1 and ten EBV2 genomes and a potential recombinant from Argentina, which were combined with two-hundred-and-thirty-nine downloaded complete genomes from other geographic regions, to produce an initial <i>multi-sample.vcf</i> file comprising 278 EBV genomes. In this context, we identified 1093/4541 positions in the viral genome that contribute to variability between viral types, mainly located in the EBNA2 and EBNA3 family of genes and the adjacent BZLF1, BZLF2, and BLLF1 genes. We further described that this variability exhibits distinct patterns across Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. Compared to EBV1 genomes, EBV2 genomes showed fewer variable positions relative to their reference genome (Wilcoxon test, <i>p</i> = 0.0001). Principal component analysis revealed that EBV2 genomes from Southeast Asia segregate independently from those from South America (Wilcoxon test, Bonferroni correction; <i>p</i> = 1.1 &#xd7; 10<sup>-7</sup>) and Africa (Wilcoxon test, Bonferroni correction; <i>p</i> = 2.6 &#xd7; 10<sup>-9</sup>). Additionally, we identified those precise variable positions with geographic segregation strength: 1135/3666 in EBV1 and 380/3276 in EBV2. Furthermore, the distribution of variable positions along the genome disclosed a close relation for EBV2 isolates from Africa and South America as compared to isolates from Southeast Asia. Although our analysis is limited to EBV2 genomes isolated from three geographic regions, this was, to the best of our knowledge, the first study to comprehensively characterize the geographic variability of the complete EBV2 genome. These findings underscore the geographic and genetic diversity of EBV2 genomes and contribute to understanding the EBV's evolutionary dynamics and potential regional adaptations. This research enhances our understanding of EBV2 genomic variability, supporting future epidemiological studies and advancing the knowledge base for targeted treatments and vaccine development for EBV-associated diseases.\n",

            "Kawasaki disease (KD) with coronary artery aneurysms (CAAs) is currently the primary cause of childhood acquired heart disease with an unclear pathogenesis. We established five groups for the discovery of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs): healthy control, febrile control, KD without CAAs, KD with small and medium CAAs, and KD with giant CAAs (<i>n</i> = 8 in each group). The validation of selected DEPs was conducted in another five groups (<i>n</i> = 4 in each group). We conducted comprehensive bioinformatics analyses to elucidate the functional roles of the DEPs in the groups of KD with CAAs and KD without CAAs. A total of 104 DEPs were identified in KD patients, which were primarily associated with complement-related pathways. A trend analysis of these 104 DEPs revealed 54 significantly changed DEPs associated with increased disease severity, which were primarily associated with G-protein-related functions. The alterations in &#x3b1;-1-antitrypsin short peptide (SERPINA1) and guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(i) subunit alpha-2 (GNAI2), which were selected from complement-related and G-protein-related pathways, respectively, were validated by Western blotting, and they were significantly decreased in KD patients with vs. without CAAs. In addition, we conducted an analysis of the DEPs in the groups of KD with CAAs and KD without CAAs, separately. There were 91 DEPs specifically expressed in KD patients with CAAs, associated with the neutrophil extracellular trap and complement pathways, while 16 DEPs were specific to those without CAAs, associated with viral infection and immunity pathways. Additionally, for DEPs among different severities of CAAs, there were 102 DEPs in KD patients with small and medium CAAs, associated with complement pathways and platelet activation pathways, whereas 34 DEPs were specific to giant CAAs, associated with the Rap1 signaling pathway and cell functions. In conclusion, this study provides plasmatic exosomal protein profiles in KD patients with CAAs, suggesting that SERPINA1 and GNIA2 might serve as novel potential diagnostic biomarkers for KD with CAAs.\n",

            "Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may develop mild respiratory symptoms but also Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Additionally, severe systemic inflammation contributes to morbidity and mortality. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the cell by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, followed by cleavage by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is known for its immune-modulating effects by suppressing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhancing regulatory T-cells. Furthermore, it has been tested in SARS-CoV-2-related clinical trials. We set out to investigate its role in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Epithelial cells (CaCo-2) were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, treated with native VIP and analyzed to investigate the mRNA and surface expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the enzyme activity of TMPRSS2 and the infection rate by a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. VIP downregulated ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA and surface expression. Beyond these direct effects, VIP mediates the shedding of surface-expressed ACE2 and TMPRSS2 via upregulation of a sheddase protease (ADAM10). Functionally, these dual mechanisms of VIP-mediated downregulation of proteins involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry resulted in a reduced infection rate by the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. These data imply that VIP hampers viral entry mechanisms based on SARS-CoV-2 and the linkage to ADAM10 may stimulate research in other indications beyond SARS-CoV-2.\n",

Although no replication-competent virus has been found in breast milk samples, breastfeeding practices during the pandemic were impacted. It is well known that breast milk is adapted to meet the needs of infants, providing the appropriate amounts of nutrients and various bioactive compounds that contribute to the maturation of the immune system and antioxidant protection, safeguarding infants against diseases. While its composition is variable, breast milk contains immune cells, antibodies, and cytokines, which have anti-inflammatory, pro-inflammatory, antiviral, and antibacterial properties that strengthen infant immunity. Since COVID-19 vaccines have not yet been approved for infants under six months of age, newborns rely on the passive transfer of antibodies via the placenta and breast milk to protect them against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several studies that analyzed breast milk samples in the context of COVID-19 have demonstrated that a strong antibody response is induced following maternal infection with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of maternal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 through natural infection and/or vaccination on the immunological composition of breast milk based on the studies conducted on this topic.\n",

            "Given the high prevalence of cannabis use among people with HIV (PWH) and its potential to modulate immune responses and reduce inflammation, this systematic review examines preclinical evidence on how tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a key compound in cannabis, affects gene and micro-RNA expression in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaques and HIV-infected human cells. Through a comprehensive search, 19 studies were identified, primarily involving SIV-infected macaques, with a pooled sample size of 176, though methodological quality varied across the studies. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs associated with THC revealed enrichment in pathways related to inflammation, epithelial cell proliferation, and adhesion. Notably, some DEGs were targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs, suggesting that epigenetic regulation may contribute to THC's effects on gene function. These findings indicate that THC may help mitigate chronic immune activation in HIV infection by altering gene and miRNA expression, suggesting its potential immunomodulatory role. However, the evidence is constrained by small sample sizes and inconsistencies across studies.

            "HIV-1 infection is successfully treated by antiretroviral therapy; however, it is not curative as HIV-1 remains present in the viral reservoir. A strategy to eliminate the viral reservoir relies on the reactivation of the latent provirus to subsequently trigger immune-mediated clearance. Here, we investigated whether the activation of Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) or RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) together with the latency reversal agent (LRA) second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspases mimetics (SMACm) leads to HIV-1 reservoir reduction and antiviral immune activation. The TLR8 and RLR agonist elicited a robust pro-inflammatory cytokine response in PBMCs from both PWH and uninfected people. Notably, co-stimulation with SMACm specifically enhanced TLR8 induced pro-inflammatory cytokine as well as CD8 T cell responses. Ex vivo treatment of PBMCs from PWH with SMACm significantly decreased the size of the inducible HIV-1 reservoir, whereas targeting TLR8 or RLR reduced the HIV-1 reservoir in 50% of PWH ex vivo. Although co-stimulation with TLR8/RLR agonists further reduced the HIV-1 reservoir in 25% of PWH ex vivo, effectively inducing antiviral immunity may help eliminate reactivated HIV-1 cells in vivo. Our findings strongly suggest that LRAs can be used in combination with agonists for pattern recognition receptors to reactivate HIV-1 and induce antiviral immunity.\n",

RT-PCR analysis confirmed the FCV presence, with subsequent CRFK cell culture propagation leading to the isolation and characterization of strain ZZ202306. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses validated the specificity of monoclonal antibodies targeting the FCV VP1 capsid protein. Transmission electron microscopy revealed non-enveloped virions of ~40 nm in diameter, exhibiting typical caliciviral architecture. Viral replication kinetics demonstrated exponential growth between 6 and 18 h post-inoculation, reaching a peak titer of 10<sup>7.96</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/0.1 mL. Genomic sequencing coupled with phylogenetic reconstruction of the <i>VP1</i> gene revealed a close genetic relation to domestic Chinese strains and international variants, while maintaining distinct evolutionary divergence from other calicivirus genera.\n",

            "Even though in mid-2023 the World Health Organization declared the end of the public health emergency of international concern status for COVID-19, many areas of uncertainty about SARS-CoV-2 infection pathophysiology remain. Although in the last 4 years pharmaceutical industries widely invested in the development of effective antiviral treatments and vaccines, large disparities in their availability worldwide still exist, thus fostering the investigation of nutritional supplements as adjuvant therapeutic approaches for disease management, especially in resource-limited settings. During the COVID-19 pandemic, vitamin D has been widely used as an over-the-counter solution to improve disease evolution, thanks to its known immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory actions. Ecological and observational studies support a relationship between hypovitaminosis D and COVID-19 negative outcomes and, according to this evidence, several research groups investigated the role of vitamin D supplementation in protecting from SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or improving disease evolution. This narrative review is intended to offer insights into the existing data on vitamin D's biological effects in respiratory infections, especially in COVID-19. Furthermore, it will also offer a brief overview of the complex interplay between vitamin D and vaccine-elicited immune response, with special attention to anti-COVID-19 vaccines.\n",

            "Lung manifestations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are often exacerbated by influenza A virus infections; however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown, and hence therapeutic options are limited. Using a physiologically relevant human lung airway-on-a-chip (Airway Chip) microfluidic culture model lined with human airway epithelium from COPD or healthy donors interfaced with pulmonary microvascular endothelium, we observed that Airway Chips lined with COPD epithelium exhibit an increased sensitivity to influenza virus infection, as is observed clinically in COPD patients. Differentiated COPD airway epithelial cells display increased inflammatory cytokine production, barrier function loss, and mucus accumulation upon virus infection. Transcriptomic analysis revealed gene expression profiles characterized by upregulation of serine proteases that may facilitate viral entry and downregulation of interferon-related genes associated with antiviral immune responses. Importantly, treatment of influenza virus-infected COPD epithelium with a protease inhibitor, nafamostat, ameliorated the disease phenotype, as evidenced by dampened viral replication, reduced mucus accumulation, and improved tissue barrier integrity. These findings suggest that targeting host serine proteases may represent a promising therapeutic avenue against influenza-afflicted COPD exacerbations.\n",

            "Passive maternal-fetal transfer of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies has been demonstrated, whilst the degree of transfer depending on the trimester of infection is lacking. Due to neonates' immature immune systems, this knowledge could be of interest when investigating the degree of early-life protection against SARS-CoV-2. For perinatal infections such as Rubella and Toxoplasmosis, the timing of infection related to gestational age is crucial for the severity of maternal-fetal outcomes; hence, the trimester of SARS-CoV-2 infection could potentially be crucial. So far, there is no stratification on all three trimesters of SARS-CoV-2 infection in relation to maternal antibody levels in SARS-CoV-2 positive women, and the degree of transfer of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to the newborn nor on obstetric and neonatal outcomes, which we examined in this study. Eleven departments in Denmark invited women who tested SARS-CoV-2 positive during pregnancy to participate with a blood sample and a cord blood sample at delivery. 459 SARS-CoV-2 positive women and 2567 SARS-CoV-2 negative women were included. A percentage of 87.5%, 95.3%, and 60.3% of newborns of women who tested positive in their first, second, and third trimester, respectively, had a significantly higher immunoglobin G (IgG) antibody level than their mother at delivery, indicating that the fetus is able to concentrate antibody levels or maintain the level of IgG antibodies transferred. None of the examined maternal-fetal outcomes were increased in women infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n",

            "The COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated the search for effective preventive and therapeutic agents. In recent years, many studies have considered the effects of different nutrients. This study aimed to investigate the association between serum monolaurin levels and the risk of developing COVID-19 among healthcare workers. In this prospective observational cohort study, 2712 healthcare workers from the University Hospital \"Maggiore della Carit&#xe0;\" in Novara, Italy were enrolled. Participants underwent blood sampling and were followed up for six months to evaluate the protective role of serum monolaurin against COVID-19 infection. Monolaurin levels were quantified using targeted metabolomic analysis. The study cohort consisted of 1000 individuals with a mean age of 46.4 years, predominantly female. Higher serum monolaurin concentrations were significantly associated with a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection at both 3- and 6-month follow-ups. The optimal cut-off value for serum monolaurin, which provides protective efficacy, was identified as 0.45 &#xb5;g/mL. Higher serum monolaurin levels appear to be associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19, suggesting its potential as a protective dietary supplement against SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the role of dietary factors in the management and prevention of infectious diseases and highlights the potential of targeted metabolomics in identifying prophylactic biomarkers.\n",

            "Blood products, including apheresis platelets and plasma, are essential for medical use but pose risks of bacterial contamination and viral transmission. Platelets are prone to bacterial growth due to their storage conditions, while plasma requires extensive screening. This study explores rapid irradiation as an innovative pathogen reduction method. A clinical linear accelerator was configured to deliver ultra-high dose rate (6 kGy/min) irradiation to platelet and plasma components. Platelets spiked with <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>; 10&#x2075; colony-forming units) were irradiated at 0.1-20 kGy, followed by bacterial growth and platelet count analysis. COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) was irradiated at 25 kGy, and receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific immunoglobulins (Ig) were assessed. Irradiation at 1 kGy reduced <i>E. coli</i> growth by 2.7-log without significant platelet loss, while 5 kGy achieved complete suppression. The estimated 6-log bacterial reduction dose (2.3 kGy) led to a 31% platelet count drop. Administering a 25 kGy virus-sterilizing dose to CCP resulted in a 9.2% decrease in RBD-specific IgG binding. This study demonstrates the proof-of-concept for rapid blood sterilization using a clinical linear accelerator. The method maintains platelet counts and CCP antibody binding at sterilizing doses, highlighting its potential as a point-of-care blood product sterilization solution.\n",

            "The BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid), a proapoptotic signaling molecule of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family, is a key regulator of mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) permeability. Uniquely positioned at the intersection of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways, Bid links death receptor signaling to the mitochondria-dependent cascade and can also be activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In its active forms, cleaved Bid (cBid) and truncated Bid (tBid), it disrupts MOM integrity via Bax/Bak-dependent and independent mechanisms. Apoptosis plays a dual role in viral infections, either promoting or counteracting viral propagation. Consequently, viruses modulate Bid signaling to favor their replication. The deregulation of Bid activity contributes to oncogenic transformation, inflammation, immunosuppression, neurotoxicity, and pathogen propagation during various viral infections. In this work, we explore Bid's structure, function, activation processes, and mitochondrial targeting. We describe its role in apoptosis induction and its involvement in infections with multiple viruses. Additionally, we discuss the therapeutic potential of Bid in antiviral strategies. Understanding Bid's signaling pathways offers valuable insights into host-virus interactions and the pathogenesis of infections. This knowledge may facilitate the development of novel therapeutic approaches to combat virus-associated diseases effectively.\n",

            "Liver cancer is the third leading cause of death globally, with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection being identified as the primary risk factor for its development. The occurrence of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is attributed to various mechanisms, such as chronic inflammation and liver cell regeneration induced by the cytotoxic immune response triggered by the virus, abnormal activation of oncogenes arising from HBV DNA insertion mutations, and epigenetic alterations mediated by viral oncoproteins. The envelope protein of the HBV virus, known as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), is a key indicator of increased risk for developing HCC in HBsAg-positive individuals. The HBsAg seroclearance status is found to be associated with recurrence in HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy. Additional evidence indicates that HBsAg is essential to the entire process of tumor development, from initiation to advancement, and acts as an oncoprotein involved in accelerating tumor progression. This review comprehensively analyzes the extensive effects and internal mechanisms of HBsAg during the various stages of the initiation and progression of HCC. Furthermore, it highlights the importance and potential applications of HBsAg in the realms of HCC early diagnosis and personalized therapeutic interventions. An in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanism of HBsAg in the occurrence and development of HCC is provided, which is expected to develop more precise and efficient strategies for the prevention and management of HCC in the future.\n",

            "Serine peptidase inhibitor, Kazal type 1 (SPINK1), a 56-amino-acid protein in its mature form, was among the first pancreatic enzymes to be extensively characterized biochemically and functionally. Synthesized primarily in pancreatic acinar cells and traditionally known as pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor, SPINK1 protects the pancreas by inhibiting prematurely activated trypsin. Since 2000, interest in SPINK1 has resurged following the discovery of genetic variants linked to chronic pancreatitis (CP). This review provides a historical overview of SPINK1's discovery, function, and gene structure before examining key genetic findings. We highlight three variants with well-characterized pathogenic mechanisms: c.-4141G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;T, a causative enhancer variant linked to the extensively studied p.Asn34Ser (c.101A&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;G), which disrupts a PTF1L-binding site within an evolutionarily conserved HNF1A-PTF1L cis-regulatory module; c.194&#x2009;+&#x2009;2T&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;C, a canonical 5' splice site GT&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;GC variant that retains 10% of wild-type transcript production; and an Alu insertion in the 3'-untranslated region, which causes complete loss of function by forming extended double-stranded RNA structures with pre-existing Alu elements in deep intronic regions. We emphasize the integration of a full-length gene splicing assay (FLGSA) with SpliceAI's predictive capabilities, establishing SPINK1 the first disease gene for which the splicing impact of all possible coding variants was prospectively determined. Findings from both mouse models and genetic association studies support the sentinel acute pancreatitis event (SAPE) model, which explains the progression from acute pancreatitis to CP. Additionally, SPINK1 variants may contribute to an increased risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Finally, we discuss the therapeutic potential of SPINK1, particularly through adeno-associated virus type 8 (AAV8)-mediated overexpression of SPINK1 as a strategy for treating and preventing pancreatitis, and highlight key areas for future research.\n",

Both aspects increase the susceptibility of older adults to viral and bacterial infections, resulting in a higher frequency and severity of infectious diseases. In this preliminary study, a cohort of 52 individuals was recruited and divided into two groups: young (age range 21-35) and older adults (&gt;&#x2009;60 years old). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected before (time 0, T0) and after (time 1, T1) the immunization with a tetravalent influenza vaccine. Then, T cell immunophenotyping analysis was conducted to investigate how aging and influenza vaccination influence T cell responses. Additionally, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of oleuropein (OLE), a secoiridoid extracted from extra virgin olive oil, alone or in combination with BIRB 796, a potent inhibitor of p38 MAPK, were explored to enhancing the impact of influenza virus on T cell activation, aiming to identify potential alternatives or complementary strategies to improve traditional flu-vaccine formulations. Statistically significant observations were noted for a decrement in CD8&#x2009;+&#x2009;T na&#xef;ve and an increase of effector memory between the young and older adults after flu-vaccination. Moreover, preliminary findings indicate anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of OLE and BIRB 796 on T cell responses, particularly regarding Reactive Oxygen Species/Reactive Nitrogen Species modulation, with a trend toward the decrease of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., Interferon-&#x3b3; (INF-&#x3b3;), Tumor Necrosis Factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;)), &#x3b1;although without statistical significance.\n",

            "Sinusitis is an inflammation of the mucous membrane of the paranasal sinuses. Bacterial sinusitis usually occurs as a complication of viral infections of the upper respiratory tract and is a frequent cause of medical consultation. The clinical presentation of acute bacterial sinusitis can vary. It most commonly manifests as an upper respiratory tract infection (nasal congestion, postnasal drip, cough) that persists for more than 10 days without clinical improvement. Unfortunately, updated guidelines in paediatric age are not currently available. The purpose of this consensus is to provide guidelines for the therapeutic management of previous healthy paediatric patients with sinusitis. A systematic review was conducted to identify the most recent and relevant evidence. Embase, Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane databases were systematically screened, combining the terms \"children\" and \"sinusitis\" and \"antibiotics\" and \"rhinosinusitis\" with a date restriction from 2012 to April 2024, but without language limitations. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methods. The final recommendations were obtained through a Delphi consensus of an expert panel. In children with a diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis, made according to strict clinical criteria, systemic empiric antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is indicated at a high dose (90&#xa0;mg/kg/day, calculated based on amoxicillin, preferably in 3 daily doses) and for at least 10 days. In children with chronic sinusitis, systemic antibiotic treatment is not recommended, and it is not possible to make any specific recommendation regarding antibiotic agents due to the scarcity of scientific evidence supporting treatment. In conclusion, the diagnosis of sinusitis is primarily clinical, and despite acute sinusitis generally having a favourable course, some cases can present orbital and intracranial complications. The misuse of antibiotics in managing upper respiratory tract infections, including acute sinusitis, and the challenges posed by antibiotic resistance are a current issue in paediatric care. Due to the scarcity, heterogeneity, and poor quality of available evidence either supporting or opposing the use of systemic antibiotic therapy in children with sinusitis prospective studies on larger and more homogeneous cohort are needed.\n",

Hence, the aim of this study was to conduct a non-probability cross-sectional survey of COVID-19 vaccine recipients in Gombe State to determine their testing status and socio-demographic profiles. A total of 872 vaccine recipients were included in this study. The descriptive analysis revealed that the median age group was 30-39 years.

            "Honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies depend on the reproductive output of their queens, which in turn is contingent on the care they receive from worker bees. Viral infections in queens can compromise their reproductive output, while viral infections in workers can inhibit the successful functioning of the colony and its ability to care for the queen. Transgenerational immune priming (TGIP) occurs when queens transfer immune-related compounds or immune elicitors to their offspring, enhancing the ability of subsequent generations to resist infections. These maternal effects on offspring could positively impact colony health and resilience to viral infections, but little is currently known about TGIP for viruses in honey bees. In this study, we investigate how viral infections affect the proteomic composition of eggs laid by queens injected with a mixture of black queen cell virus and deformed wing virus B, both in controlled experimental settings and natural field conditions. Our results showed that virus-challenged queens upregulated immune effectors in their eggs and ovaries. In contrast, naturally infected queens from field surveys did not; there were no significant differences in egg protein, lipid, or metabolite composition related to maternal viral load or ovary size. However, egg collection date strongly influenced the protein, lipid, and metabolite composition of eggs, potentially reflecting seasonal variations in pollen resources. These findings suggest that while viral infections can induce transgenerational effects on egg proteomes under short-term experimental conditions, such effects are less apparent in natural settings and can be overshadowed by seasonal and other ecological factors.\n",

This study explored the impact of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-specific T-cell memory phenotypes and function among participants with latent TB infection and DM (LTBI-DM) at baseline and after 6 months of IPT; and compared the responses to healthy controls (HC). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with ESAT-6 and CFP-10 peptide pools to analyse CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses using flow cytometry. In LTBI-DM participants, effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were decreased post-IPT, suggesting a shift towards a less-activated state or differentiation into other subsets. CXCR5 expression on both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was upregulated, while PD-1 expression was downregulated post-IPT, indicating reduced T-cell exhaustion and improved homing capabilities. Lastly, IL-17&#xa0;A and IL-13 production in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was increased post-IPT, respectively, which play a role in enhanced Mtb infection control. The post-IPT T-cell alterations were similar to normal HC levels. These findings suggest that IPT modulates and normalises specific T-cell memory phenotypes and functional responses in LTBI-DM participants, potentially contributing to improved long-term immunity and protection against TB. This study highlights the importance of preventive therapy in high-risk populations, and larger studies with more extended follow-up are needed to assess long-lasting IPT effects.\n",

Here, we report on an M-targeting molecule, CIM-834, that blocks the assembly of SARS-CoV-2. CIM-834 was obtained through high-throughput phenotypic antiviral screening followed by medicinal-chemistry efforts and target elucidation. CIM-834 inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (including a broad panel of variants) and SARS-CoV. In SCID mice and Syrian hamsters intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2, oral treatment reduced lung viral titres to nearly undetectable levels, even (as shown in mice) when treatment was delayed until 24&#x2009;h before the end point. Treatment of infected hamsters prevented transmission to untreated sentinels. Transmission electron microscopy studies show that virion assembly is completely absent in cells treated with CIM-834. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reveals that CIM-834 binds and stabilizes the M protein in its short form, thereby preventing the conformational switch to the long form, which is required for successful particle assembly. In conclusion, we have discovered a new druggable target in the replication cycle of coronaviruses and a small molecule that potently inhibits it.\n",

Here we developed stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist-based ER-targeting molecules (SABER), which effectively deliver antigens to the ER and cluster key machinery in cross-presentation to form microreactors by folding the ER membrane. Conjugation of SABER to various antigens substantially enhances the induction of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immune responses to tumour neoantigens and conserved viral epitopes, far exceeding that achieved by mixtures of antigens with STING agonists or conventional adjuvants. SABER also retains a potent adjuvant effect, effectively enhancing the ability of a SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies. This study provides a high-affinity ER-targeting delivery system and vaccine adjuvant, demonstrating that precise subcellular delivery targeting the last mile of cross-presentation can lead to a qualitative leap.\n",

            "The membrane (M) protein of betacoronaviruses is well conserved and has a key role in viral assembly<sup>1,2</sup>. Here we describe the identification of JNJ-9676, a small-molecule inhibitor targeting the coronavirus M protein. JNJ-9676 demonstrates in vitro nanomolar antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and sarbecovirus strains from bat and pangolin zoonotic origin. Using cryogenic electron microscopy&#xa0;(cryo-EM), we determined a binding pocket of JNJ-9676 formed by the transmembrane domains of the M protein dimer. Compound binding stabilized the M protein dimer in an altered conformational state between its long and short forms, preventing the release of infectious virus. In a pre-exposure Syrian golden hamster model, JNJ-9676 (25&#x2009;mg per kg twice per day) showed excellent efficacy, illustrated by a significant reduction in viral load and infectious virus in the lung by 3.5 and 4 log<sub>10</sub>-transformed RNA copies and 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>) per mg lung, respectively. Histopathology scores at this dose were reduced to the baseline. In a post-exposure hamster model, JNJ-9676 was efficacious at 75&#x2009;mg per kg twice per day even when added at 48&#x2009;h after infection, when peak viral loads were observed. The M protein is an attractive antiviral target to block coronavirus replication, and JNJ-9676 represents an interesting chemical series towards identifying clinical candidates addressing the current and future coronavirus pandemics.\n",

            "An accurate spatial representation of protein-protein interaction networks is needed to achieve a realistic and biologically relevant representation of interactomes. Here, we leveraged the spatial information included in Proximity-Dependent Biotin Identification (BioID) interactomes of SARS-CoV-2 proteins to calculate weighted distances and model the organization of the SARS-CoV-2-human interactome in three dimensions (3D) within a cell-like volume. Cell regions with viral occupancy were highlighted, along with the coordination of viral proteins exploiting the cellular machinery. Profiling physical intra-virus and virus-host contacts enabled us to demonstrate both the accuracy and the predictive value of our 3D map for direct interactions, meaning that proteins in closer proximity tend to interact physically. Several functionally important virus-host complexes were detected, and robust structural models were obtained, opening the way to structure-directed drug discovery screens. This PPI discovery pipeline approach brings us closer to a realistic spatial representation of interactomes, which, when applied to viruses or other pathogens, can provide significant information for infection. Thus, it represents a promising tool for coping with emerging infectious diseases.\n",

            "At present, with increasing awareness of the relationship between respiratory disease and air pollution, it is critical to assess the environmental risk factors for influenza. This study aimed to estimate the associations between ambient air pollution and the number of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases in Hangzhou, China, from 2015 to 2021. Weekly meteorological data, including average ambient temperature and average relative humidity, from December 29, 2014 to January 2, 2022 were collected from the Hangzhou Meteorological Service Center, and air pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), ground-level ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;2.5&#xa0;&#x3bc;m (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), and PM with aerodynamic diameter&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;10&#xa0;&#x3bc;m (PM<sub>10</sub>), were collected from National Ambient Air Quality Automatic Monitoring Stations in Hangzhou. The number of weekly ILI cases was collected from 15 influenza surveillance sentinel hospitals in Hangzhou. A generalized linear model (GLM) with quasi-Poisson regression was adopted to estimate the association between air pollution and ILI. After adjusting for the effects of average temperature, relative humidity, and seasonal and long-term trends, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> were found to be significantly associated with the number of ILI cases, with relative risk (RR) values of 1.018 (95% CI 1.001-1.036), 1.016 (1.005-1.028), 1.063 (1.067-1.364), and 1.207 (1.067-1.364), respectively. In the two-pollutant model, putting PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, or SO<sub>2</sub> into the model separately with O<sub>3</sub> produced results similar to those of the single-pollutant model. PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub> have statistical significance in cold seasons, with the RR values of 1.020 (95% CI 1.001-1.038), 1.012 (95% CI 1.000-1.024), and 1.060 (95% CI 1.031-1.090), respectively. In summary, our study found that most air pollutants (PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub>) have a significant association with the risk of ILI cases in Hangzhou. These findings can serve as a reference for the formulation of effective protective measures.\n",

            "Previous research demonstrated Non-Hispanic Black populations experience higher COVID-19 mortality rates than Non-Hispanic White individuals. Additionally, cancer status is a known risk factor for COVID-19 death. While prior studies investigated comorbidities as exploratory variables in differences in COVID-19 hospitalization, none have explored their role in COVID-19-related deaths. This study aimed to evaluate whether Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and subsequently, individual diseases are potential explanatory variables for this relationship. The analysis focused on Non-Hispanic Black and Non-Hispanic White cancer patients aged 20 or older, diagnosed between 2011 and 2019, who tested positive for COVID-19 from the start of pandemic through June 30, 2021 from Louisiana Tumor Registry. Two separate mediation analyses were conducted. First checked whether overall comorbidity, measured by CCI, could explain the difference in COVID-19 mortality. If so, further checked which individual comorbidities contributed to this difference. The hazard rate for Non-Hispanic Black cancer patients dying from COVID-19 was 6.46 times than that of Non-Hispanic White patients. The CCI accounted for 12.7% of the differences observed in COVID-19 mortality, with renal disease as the top contributor, explaining 4.9%. These findings could help develop interventions to reduce COVID-19 mortality and address the disproportionate impact, especially by managing chronic conditions like renal disease.\n",

            "Globally, there are 1.2&#xa0;million new chronic Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infections every year. The UAE is a low-endemic region where no previous studies have explored HBV stigma. This study aims to evaluate the UAE's population HBV knowledge, HBV vaccine attitudes, and stigmatizing attitudes towards the HBV infection. A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate knowledge and stigma; the previously-developed and validated stigma scale (Hepatitis B Virus - Stigma Scale, HBV-SS) was used. A total of 601 responses were retained for analysis in both python-3 and R. Chi-squared, Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for bivariate analyses and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was used for linear modelling. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted, and goodness-of-fit was evaluated. Overall, 77.5%, (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;466/601) reported having some knowledge regarding HBV, only 19.3% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;90/466) had good knowledge regarding HBV, with most gaps occurring with symptoms, complications, and treatment of the infection. However, 84.03% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;505/601) were interested in learning more about the virus. Only 57.6% (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;346/601) were aware of the existence of the vaccine; however, attitudes to it were overwhelmingly positive. Overall, non-stigmatising attitudes dominated; however, both labelling and separating domains highlighted specific items with highly stigmatising attitudes. CFA showed the HBV-SS model to have acceptable/good goodness-of-fit. OLS identified higher knowledge levels among healthcare workers and those with higher perceived knowledge. Only perceived knowledge was a significant predictor of lower stigma beyond the bivariate level. The UAE population has shown low levels of knowledge but overall non-stigmatising attitudes. It is imperative that campaigns focus on improving general population HBV infection and vaccine knowledge while also solidifying the widespread level of vaccine acceptance and non-stigmatising attitudes.\n",

            "Background Patients with hematological malignancies (HMs), particularly those who have undergone bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), are at greater risk for morbidity and mortality due to immunosuppression. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these vulnerabilities in HM patients, although comprehensive data specifically on HSCT recipients are limited. Objective This study investigated the clinical and demographic profiles of HSCT recipients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Spain. We also identified factors associated with in-hospital mortality in HSCT patients. Methods We conducted a nationwide, retrospective analysis using data from the Spanish National Health System. We included hospitalized patients with HMs and COVID-19 infection from 2020 to 2022. We used descriptive statistics, multivariate logistic regression, and survival analyses to assess predictors of mortality. Results In total, 35,648 patients with HMs were included, of whom 2,324 (6.5%) had undergone HSCT. The in-hospital mortality rate for HSCT recipients was 13%, lower than the 20% observed in non-HSCT patients. Older age, dementia, acute leukemia, and solid tumors were independently associated with increased mortality. In spite of their immunosuppressed state, HSCT recipients experienced relatively favorable outcomes, suggesting partial immune recovery following transplantation. Conclusions HSCT recipients with COVID-19 present different clinical characteristics and mortality risks than non-recipients. These findings indicate the need for specific management strategies for this vulnerable population. Further research is needed to explore immunological recovery and the transplant-specific factors that may influence COVID-19 outcomes.\n",

            "The persistent monkeypox outbreaks intensify the demand for monkeypox vaccines. Based on the mRNA vaccine platform, we conduct a systematic screening of monkeypox virus (MPXV) surface proteins from two types of viral particles, extracellular enveloped viruses (EVs) and intracellular mature viruses (MVs). This screening unveils 12 important antigens with diverse levels of neutralizing immunogenicity. Further assessment reveals that the combinations of 4, 8, and 12 of these antigens, namely Mix-4, Mix-8, and Mix-12, induce varying degrees of immune protection, with Mix-12 being the most potent. This finding demonstrates the significance of not only the level but also the diversity of the neutralizing antibodies in providing potent immune protection. Additionally, we utilize a T cell-epitope enrichment strategy, analyzing the complete proteome sequence of the MPXV to predict antigenic epitope-rich regions. Integration of these epitope-rich regions into a cellular immune-targeting antigen, named MPX-EPs, showcases that a cellular immune-targeting mRNA vaccine can independently confer immune protection. Furthermore, co-immunization with Mix-12 and MPX-EPs achieves complete protection against MPXV challenge. Overall, these results suggest an effective approach to enhance the immune protection of mRNA vaccines through the specific coordination of humoral and cellular immune responses.\n",

            "Samul-tang (SM) is a traditional prescription widely used in clinical practice for the management of gynecological diseases, especially for menstrual regulation and infertility treatment. We previously reported its efficacy in increasing mature oocyte production and improving ovarian reserves, potentially regulated by rat sarcoma virus (Ras) signaling in the ovaries of aged mice. Although the main ingredients of SM are known, the bioactive compounds responsible for protecting ovarian function during aging remain unidentified. This study aimed to identify the active compounds that significantly contribute to the therapeutic potential of SM against age-related decline in ovarian function. The combination of butylphthalide and oleanolic acid improved mature oocyte production similar to that in SM-administered aged mice. Subsequently, we identified butylphthalide as an active compound that mimicked SM's effect on enhancing ovarian reserve. This study introduces a novel strategy for identifying active compounds in multi-component herbal medicines by evaluating compound combinations in an in vivo model, offering promising therapeutic avenues for age-related female infertility through targeted gene expression modulation.\n",

            "Fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) gene has been extensively reported to play its role in potential gut microbiota changes and norovirus susceptibility. The normal activity of FUT2 has been found to be disrupted by non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in its gene. To explore the possible mutational changes and their deleterious effects, we employed state-of-the-art computational strategies. Firstly, nine widely-used bioinformatics tools were utilized for initial screening of possibly deleterious nsSNPs. Subsequently, the structural and functional effects of screened nsSNPs on FUT2 were evaluated by utilizing relevant computational tools. Following this, the two shortlisted nsSNPs, including G149S (rs200543547) and V196G (rs367923363), were further validated by their molecular docking with norovirus capsid protein, VP1. As compared to wild-type, the higher stability and lower binding energy scores of the both the mutants indicated their stable binding with VP1, which ultimately leads to norovirus implications. These docking results were further verified by a comprehensive computational approach, molecular dynamic simulation, which gave results in the form of lower RMSD, RMSF, RoG, and hydrogen bond values of both the mutants, depicted in relevant graphs. Overall, this research explores and validated the two FUT2 nsSNPs (G146S and V196G), which may possibly linked with the norovirus susceptibility and gut microbiota changes. Moreover, our findings highlights the value of computational strategies in mutational analysis and welcomes any further experimental validation.\n",

Targeting of these enhancers by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference or hybrid ecDNA by bromodomain and extra-terminal inhibitor reduces E6/E7 expression, and significantly inhibites in vitro and/or in vivo growth only in ecDNA(+) models.

While gastrointestinal pathology in CVID has been well-documented, data on gastrointestinal manifestations in GS are limited. In this study, we analyzed two cases of GS, both demonstrating marked reduction of plasma cells across multiple gastrointestinal sites, with variable intraepithelial lymphocytosis and mild to moderate villous blunting in the duodenum and features secondary to chronic norovirus infection in one case, and an invasive adenocarcinoma with notable depletion of lamina propria plasma cells in the other.

However, side effects are not always directly caused by a medicine or vaccine and can instead be the result of negative expectations&#x2014;a process known as the nocebo effect. This study investigated whether demographic and psychological factors influenced the number of symptoms people reported after flu vaccination and whether they attributed these to vaccine side effects. In this study, 225 university students completed a questionnaire assessing demographic and psychological variables before receiving a flu vaccination and then completed another questionnaire assessing symptoms and side effects immediately after vaccination and 1-week later. The results showed that people with higher anxiety and who believed they were sensitive to vaccines reported more symptoms. These symptoms were more likely to be interpreted as vaccine side effects if people were younger, female, and had greater anxiety. The study suggests that different factors influence whether symptoms are first noticed and if they then get interpreted as vaccine side effects. This finding could be used to inform future interventions to help reduce the reporting of side effects and improve vaccine acceptance.\n",

            "Naf1 (Nef-associated factor 1) is a host protein that interacts with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Nef protein. We and others have previously demonstrated that Naf1 restricts HIV-1 infection of T-lymphocytes. Myeloid cells are targets for HIV infection, but Naf1 expression in myeloid cells and whether it also regulates HIV infection in these cells are not yet identified. In this study, we found that Naf1 had a higher expression in CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes than in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs), and its expression in both types of cells could be induced by HIV-1 gp120 glycoproteins or viral particles. Importantly, the expression of Naf1 restricted HIV-1 infection in monocytes and MDDCs. Functional investigation showed that both the constitutive and the induced expression of Naf1 inhibited NF-&#x3ba;B signaling in MDDCs and reduced the basal level or LPS (Lipopolysaccharide)-stimulated production of cytokines. Moreover, Naf1 reduced the expression of ICAM-1 (intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1) on MDDCs and compromised their capacity to prime the activation of resting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in co-culture. In light of the essential role of NF-&#x3ba;B signaling for HIV-1 transcription, Naf1-mediated inhibition of NF-&#x3ba;B signaling may hinder a robust viral replication in MDDCs and help maintain viral persistence. Furthermore, virus-induced Naf1 expression in MDDCs may diminish the cross-talk between DC (dendritic cell) and T cells, hence suppressing the activation of antiviral immune responses. Taken together, we identified the new function of Naf1 in myeloid cells. Those findings may facilitate the understanding for the host restriction of HIV-1 infection in myeloid cells.\n",

            "In recent years, the role of the intestinal microbiota in regulating host health and immune balance has attracted widespread attention. This study provides an in-depth analysis of the close relationship between the intestinal microbiota and respiratory system diseases, with a focus on three common respiratory virus infections, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and influenza virus. The research indicates that during RSV infection, there is a significant decrease in intestinal microbial diversity, suggesting the impact of the virus on the intestinal ecosystem. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, there are evident alterations in the intestinal microbiota, which are positively correlated with the severity of the disease. Similarly, influenza virus infection is associated with dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota, and studies have shown that the application of specific probiotics exhibits beneficial effects against influenza virus infection. Further research indicates that the intestinal microbiota exerts a wide and profound impact on the occurrence and development of respiratory system diseases through various mechanisms, including modulation of the immune system and production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). This article comprehensively analyzes these research advances, providing new perspectives and potential strategies for the prevention and treatment of future respiratory system diseases. This study not only deepens our understanding of the relationship between the intestinal microbiota and respiratory system diseases but also offers valuable insights for further exploring the role of host-microbiota interactions in the development of diseases.\n",

Sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) is reported globally and an infant mortality rate of 23.129 per 1 000 live births has been reported in the Western Cape, South Africa, in 2024. Infections are often confirmed in SUDI cases admitted to the Tygerberg Medico-legal Mortuary in Cape Town, but molecular diversity in respiratory viruses is underreported. A total of 162 previously confirmed polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive trachea and / or lung samples from SUDI cases collected between 2015 and 2019 were retested for either rhinovirus or human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Sixty-four samples were positive for rhinovirus and 15 for RSV. Results from 5 of all positive samples were outside the the PCR assay amplification limits determined by the cycle threshold (Ct) value and were excluded. Another 4 samples did not amplify, and the remaining 70 underwent subsequent sequencing, but successful sequences could only be obtained in 53 samples. All three rhinovirus (A, B and C) genotypes were identified, with RV-A most prevalent, followed by RV-C and RV-B. RSV-A and RSV-B were detected equally, and after amino acid alignment, 20 amino acid duplication and nine substitutions were found that confirmed two RSV-BA9 genotypes. This study describes the molecular and phylogenetic characterisation of specific respiratory viruses in SUDI cases in South Africa. However, the rapid decline in viral viability in post-mortem samples does not allow correlation between viral genotypes and cause of death or disease severity. Future prospective studies should therefore investigate temporality and associations between specific viral strains and clinical disease severity and mortality.\n",

            "Older people's oral health often deteriorates upon admission to care homes, with a detrimental impact on their quality of life, general health and well-being. There are links between poor oral health, nutrition and hydration, community-acquired aspiration pneumoniae and frailty. In 2016, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence issued guideline NG48 on oral health for adults in care homes to maintain and improve residents' oral health and ensure their timely access to dental treatment. The guideline was aimed at care home managers, staff caring for residents, dental services and local authorities. Reports undertaken by the Care Quality Commission after the release of NG48 found that implementation and awareness of the guidance were inadequate. Suboptimal oral health standards have been exacerbated further by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, when dental access was further limited, resulting in substantial waiting times for dental care. As the care home population grows with increasing health complexities, further evidence is needed to help ensure that NG48 guidance is implemented to make it standard practice. Outcomes from oral health improvement programmes and high-quality research in care homes are required to support further investment for this underserved population. Geriatricians within the community and multidisciplinary teams should include oral health as part of the comprehensive geriatric assessment for care home residents.\n",

            "Despite advancements in the field of directly acting anti-viral (DAA) therapies, viral infections still continue to pose significant global health challenges. The efficacy of DAAs are often hindered by mutations, origin of new strains, development of resistance and lack of broad spectrum effectiveness. Furthermore, patients with advanced-stage diseases may require higher doses and combinations of different DAA therapies, raising concerns about tolerability and safety. To overcome all these constraints, non-antiviral therapies that focuses on host mechanisms (also known as host-focused therapies) are emerging as an innovative approach. Host focused therapy aims to target the host molecules and pathways that are essential for viral infection and disease progression. Along with addressing the above mentioned challenges, these host focused therapies can also modulate excessive inflammatory responses. Recent advancements in understanding host-virus interactions and the pathways involved in the pathogenesis of severe viral infections from viral entry and replication to disease progression, have accelerated the development of host-focused therapies aimed at combating these infections. This review explores the growing rationale and various opportunities for host-focused therapies for severe viral infections including zika virus, dengue, HIV, influenza, and covid-19 to name a few. In addition, current clinical trial information on various classes of host focused therapies are presented, highlighting their therapeutic potential and significance in the field.\n",

            "It is a high priority to enhance the efficacy of seasonal influenza vaccines based on hemagglutinin (HA) strain-specific neutralizing immunity. Here, we investigated a vaccination strategy of supplementing inactivated split seasonal vaccines with a virus-like particle vaccine containing multi-subtype neuraminidase (NA) and M2 ectodomain (M2e) repeat (NA-M2e) in mice. NA-M2e and split combined vaccine (S&#xa0;+&#xa0;NA-M2e) stimulated a unique pattern of innate immune responses within a day after intramuscular injection of mice. The combined S&#xa0;+&#xa0;NA-M2e vaccination induced enhanced levels of IgG antibodies to viral antigens, hemagglutination inhibiting activities, and humoral and cellular immune responses to NA and M2e. The addition of NA-M2e to split vaccination provided higher efficacy of protection against homologous and heterologous viruses compared to split alone, where NA-M2e significantly contributed to enhancing protection under na&#xef;ve and primed mouse models. This study supports a vaccination strategy to improve the efficacy of seasonal vaccines by providing additional immunity to NA and M2e.\n",

            "After the COVID-19 pandemic, nonhuman primate (NHP) models, which are necessary for the rapid development of vaccines and new medical therapies, have become important in studies on infectious diseases because of their genetic, metabolic, and immunological similarities to humans. Our group has long been using NHP models in studies on infectious diseases including H1N1 influenza pandemic and COVID-19. Despite limitations such as the limited number of animals and the husbandry requirements, NHP models have contributed to the prediction of the pathogenicity of emerging viruses and the evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics due to the similarity of NHP models to humans before starting clinical trials to select good candidates of vaccines and drugs. In this review, the findings obtained in NHP infectious disease models of influenza and COVID-19 are summarized to clarify the benefits of NHP models for studies on infectious diseases. We believe that this review will support future research in exploring new perspectives for the development of vaccines and therapies targeting influenza, COVID-19, and infectious diseases in future pandemics.\n",

            "The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is pivotal to prevent new HPV infections and associated diseases globally, which requires a multi-dose regimen to maximize protection. A long-acting HPV vaccine that can be administered in a single immunization during a doctor's visit would be highly desirable if comparable benefits are provided to that of standard of care (SoC). This work explored the development of a sustained-release HPV vaccine formulation via temperature-programmed loading of polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) microparticles (MPs). Traditional methods for fabricating HPV-loaded MPs suffer from HPV virus-like particles (VLP) structure/function loss due to exposure to organic solvents, shear stress, etc. This approach separates the microparticle fabrication from VLP loading thereby effectively minimized common stress conditions during formulation. The HPV-loaded PLGA MPs demonstrated significantly prolonged injection site retention as a depot and successfully elicited robust immunogenicity in a dose-dependent manner in vivo. However, a single dose of HPV MPs alone resulted in lower immunogenicity compared to GARDASIL&#xae;9 (G9, laboratory prepared material equivalent in composition) prime/boost in a rabbit model, likely due to the lack of an effective adjuvant in the formulation. Alternatively, concomitant administration of HPV MPs and G9 at separate injection sites was shown to induce noninferior antibody titers and durable immune response compared to the current SoC multi-dose regimen. It was hypothesized that the bolus dose of G9 served as potent prime while sustained release of HPV antigens from MPs exerted booster effect. Despite the cost benefits and convenience offered by a single injection of HPV vaccine, the co-formulation of HPV MPs with G9 remains a challenging area. In summary, this work successfully demonstrated the feasibility of developing a sustained-release formulation of HPV vaccine and provided valuable insights into challenges and opportunities of formulation design to improve efficacy, safety, and tolerability as a single-dose HPV vaccine.\n",

            "Hindered by the challenges of blood-brain barrier (BBB) hindrance, tumor heterogeneity and immunosuppressive microenvironment, patients with breast cancer brain metastasis have yet to benefit from current clinical treatments, experiencing instead a decline in quality of life due to radiochemotherapy. While virus-mimicking nanosystems (VMN) mimicking viral infection processes show promise in treating peripheral tumors, the inability to modulate the immunosuppressive microenvironment limits the efficacy against brain metastasis. Accordingly, a VMN-based triple immunomodulatory strategy is initially proposed, aiming to activate innate and adaptive immune responses and reverse the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Here, manganese-based virus-mimicking nanomedicine (Vir-HD@HM) with intratumoral drug enrichment is engineered. Vir-HD@HM can induce the immune response through the activation of cGAS-STING by mimicking the in vivo infection process of herpesviruses. Meanwhile, DNAzyme mimicking the genome can rescue the epigenetic silencing of PTEN with the assistance of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, thus ameliorating the immunosuppressive metastatic microenvironment and achieving synergistic sensitizing therapeutic efficacy. In vivo experiments substantiate the efficacy of Vir-HD@HM in recruiting NK cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to metastatic foci, inhibiting Treg cells infiltration, and prolonging murine survival without adjunctive radiochemotherapy. This study demonstrates that Vir-HD@HM with triple immunomodulation offers an encouraging therapeutic option for patients with brain metastasis.\n",

The initiative's intersectional approach involved Black women with HIV in program development and implementation. Quantitative data from 743 participants highlighted disparities in employment and housing, emphasizing the need for holistic, culturally sensitive care. In quantitative responses, participants, regardless of gender identity, reported HIV-related stigma and racial discrimination, with transgender women qualitatively reporting additional gender-based inequities that affect their HIV health outcomes and quality of life. We summarize findings from the initiative and provide recommendations to address intersectional barriers to care to improve health and well-being among Black women with HIV.

            "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent joint disease characterized by pain, disability, and loss of physical function, posing a challenge to public health. However, molecular mechanisms of OA pathogenesis have not been fully described. We report that tripartite motif containing 15 (TRIM15) is a regulator in chondrocyte senescence and OA. Our study revealed heightened expression of TRIM15 in chondrocytes of senescent cartilage from patients with OA and in aged wild-type mice. Using gain- and loss-of-function studies, we found that TRIM15 facilitated human chondrocyte senescence. Conditional deletion of <i>Trim15</i> in mouse chondrocytes severely impaired skeletal growth, partially because of impaired embryonic chondrocyte senescence. Compared with conditionally knocked out <i>Col2a1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>/Trim15<sup>flox/flox</sup></i> mice, <i>Trim15</i><sup>flox/flox</sup> control mice exhibited accelerated OA phenotypes, increased senescence markers, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype during aging. Mechanistically, TRIM15 bound with yes-associated protein (YAP) and mediated K48-linked YAP ubiquitination at K254, which interrupted the interaction between YAP and angiomotin, leading to enhanced YAP nuclear translocation. Dysregulation of TRIM15-YAP and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) signaling promoted OA progression in both the surgery-induced and natural aging-induced mouse OA model. Intra-articular injection of adeno-associated virus 5 (AAV5)-<i>Trim15</i> shRNA decelerated OA progression in mice. In particular, YAP and TAZ protein amounts were increased in chondrocytes of patients with OA. Our preclinical results demonstrated that the AAV5-<i>TRIM15</i> shRNA treatment protected human OA explants against degeneration through inhibiting chondrocyte senescence. Together, our findings underscore the potential of targeting TRIM15 in reshaping the aging cartilage microenvironment and suggest a promising therapeutic avenue for OA.\n",

It is present in Africa, Europe, Asia, and in the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. There are no effective treatments or broadly licensed vaccines to prevent disease. Efforts to counteract ASF have been hampered because of the lack of convenient tools to engineer its etiological agent, ASF virus (ASFV), largely due to its large noninfectious genome. Here, we report the use of synthetic genomics methodology to develop a reverse genetics system for ASFV using a CRISPR-Cas9-inhibited self-helper virus to reconstitute live recombinant ASFV from synthetic genomes to rapidly generate a variety of combinatorial mutants of ASFV. The method will substantially facilitate the development of therapeutics or subunit and live-attenuated vaccines for ASF. This synthetic genomics-based approach has wide-ranging impact because it can be applied to rapidly develop reverse genetics tools for emerging viruses with noninfectious genomes.\n",

The emergence of kdr gene mutations in Ae. albopictus has reduced the efficacy of insecticide-based control. We investigated the genetic structure of eight Ae. albopictus populations from China's southeastern coastal region, analyzing genetic diversity, population structure, and the prevalence of kdr mutations in relation to dengue fever incidence. Allelic diversity was moderate, with the number of alleles ranging from 2 to 6 and effective number of alleles from 1.52 to 5.00. Genetic clustering revealed four groups with 0.71% to 1.81% variation, indicating moderate differentiation. The coefficient of genetic differentiation value was 0.07 to 0.18, and Nm values 1.13 to 3.25. Except for Foshan and Sanming, four populations showed deltamethrin resistance, 4.31 to 18.87-fold. The voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene analysis identified non-synonymous mutations, with I1532 mutations absent in Sanming and F1534 present in all. Four populations showed resistance to deltamethrin, with resistance levels varying significantly. The VGSC gene analysis revealed multiple non-synonymous mutations associated with resistance, particularly at positions I1532 and F1534. No significant correlation was found between dengue fever incidence, kdr mutations, and genetic indicators, indicating a consistent potential for disease transmission. However, populations with higher genetic diversity had lower frequencies of F1534 and higher frequencies of I1532I mutations. The findings underscore the significant influence of kdr mutations on the effectiveness of mosquito control strategies. The presence of these mutations necessitates the implementation of alternative insecticides and integrated pest management approaches to sustainably reduce Ae. albopictus populations and mitigate the spread of dengue fever.\n",

            "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is still a severe concern, especially in Africa with suboptimal intention rates of vaccination. This flagged the requirement of plant-based remedies as an alternative treatment. In this study we integrated metabolomics and chemometrics approaches with In silico and In vitro approaches to accelerate and unravel compounds from commonly used South African plants that may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The selected commonly used plants, Artemisia afra and Artemisia annua, were found to be non-toxic against Vero cells, as determined by the resazurin cell viability assay. Metabolites profiling revealed eighty-one compounds and the top three hit compounds, quercetin 3-O-(6\"-acetyl-glucoside), 2\"-O-acetylrutin, and quercetin 3-(6\"-malonyl-glucoside), had binding affinities of -9.3 kcal/mol, -9.5 kcal/mol, and -9.3 kcal/mol, respectively. The 2\"-O-acetyl group of the rutin moiety and quercetin moiety produces a hydrogen bond with the amide nitrogen of His41 and with the side chain carboxylate of Cys145, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed a stable binding of the docked complexes. In silico observations were validated by In vitro bioassay, which flagged the ability of these compounds to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The collected analysed data of this study does not only draw special attention to the surfaced 2\"-O-acetylrutin as the best suitable inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, but also indirectly reveals the importance of integrating metabolomics and chemometrics approaches with In silico and In vitro approaches to accelerate and unravel compounds from South African commonly used plants.\n",

            "The COVID-19 pandemic changed employment conditions and childcare availability worldwide. This contributed to higher work-related stress among working parents, which in turn may have led to lower relationship satisfaction. This study examined the prospective associations between psychosocial work stress or work-privacy conflict (WPC) and relationship satisfaction among parents of young children during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, this study aimed to investigate a potential mediating role of psychological symptoms, i.e., symptoms of depression and anger/hostility, and to determine whether this applies equally to mothers and fathers. Longitudinal data were derived from the German, prospective cohort study DREAMCORONA. Working and cohabiting mothers (n =&#x2009; 138) and fathers (n =&#x2009; 187) completed questionnaires on psychosocial work stress, WPC, and psychological symptoms from May-June 2020 (T1) and on relationship satisfaction from October-December 2020 (T2). Mediation analyses were conducted separately for mothers and fathers, controlling for working from home and number of children. Mediation effects were found only for fathers. Higher levels of psychosocial work stress were associated with higher levels of symptoms of depression, which in turn predicted lower relationship satisfaction. The prospective association between higher paternal WPC and lower relationship satisfaction was mediated by higher symptoms of both depression and anger/hostility. No mediation effects were found for mothers. However, also in mothers, psychosocial work stress was associated with symptoms of depression, whereas WPC was associated with symptoms of both depression and anger/hostility. This study highlights the importance of identifying protective mechanisms for working parents to maintain mental health and satisfying romantic relationships in times of crisis and beyond. To develop targeted prevention approaches, it appears advantageous to continue examining sex differences. Additionally, it is essential to educate working parents about the potential risks associated with work-related stress and to ensure the availability of stable counselling services.\n",

            "Molnupiravir, an orally administered drug for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19, is a prodrug of the ribonucleoside &#x3b2;-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC). NHC incorporation in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA strand causes an accumulation of deleterious errors in the genome, resulting in reduced viral infectivity and replication. Exposure-response (E-R) analyses for viral RNA mutation rate and virologic outcomes were conducted using data from three phase 2/3 studies of molnupiravir (P006, MOVe-IN, and MOVe-OUT). Three dose levels (200, 400, and 800&#x2009;mg every 12 hours&#xa0;[Q12H]) and placebo were evaluated. E-R datasets were generated for SARS-CoV-2 RNA mutation and longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral load. E-R models were defined for RNA mutation rate and viral load change from baseline at days 5 and 10. The models supported plasma NHC AUC<sub>0-12</sub> as the appropriate pharmacokinetic driver for assessing E-R relationships. The highest percentage of participants with &gt; 20 low-frequency nucleotide substitutions (LNS) per 10,000 bases, a measure of likely meaningful drug effect, was predicted in the 800&#x2009;mg Q12H treatment group. A strong drug effect on the reduction of viral load was observed on days 5 and 10. E-R relationships were best represented by an E<sub>max</sub> structural model with reasonable consistency in the estimated AUC<sub>50</sub>s (~2.3-fold), across the models, of 10,260 and 4390&#x2009;nM*hr. for day 5 viral load change from baseline and LNS error rate, respectively. These biomarker E-R curves support the choice of 800&#x2009;mg Q12H as providing near-maximal drug effect, consistent with findings from the previously published molnupiravir E-R model of clinical outcomes.\n",

            "Post-stroke dysphagia (PSD) is common and associated with poor outcomes. We aimed to explore the feasibility, safety, and proof of concept of cerebellar rTMS in patients with sub-acute PSD. We intended to recruit 48 participants with PSD. Randomised to: (i) sham treatment twice-daily for five days, (ii) cerebellar rTMS daily for three days, and (iii) cerebellar rTMS twice-daily for five days (1:1:1). Participants were blinded to treatment group. Primary outcomes were feasibility, safety, and functional outcome intake scale (FOIS), dysphagia severity rating scale (DSRS), and feeding status scale (FSS) at two weeks. However, due to lower-than-expected enrolment, the active rTMS groups were combined. We recruited 14 participants in total, (mean 68 years, 57% female). Due to the time-limited funding period, recruitment was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. DSRS and FSS trended lower in the combined active rTMS groups at two weeks, i.e. less swallowing impairment. However, at death/discharge FOIS was higher/better (mean, (standard deviation)), 4.0 (2.1) vs. 1.8 (1.0) (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.032) with active TMS, with trends to lower/better DSRS and FSS. There was no difference in the acceptability of treatment between groups. High-intensity (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5) vs. low-intensity (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5) cerebellar rTMS was associated with lower DSRS 3.0 (1.4) vs. 9.4 (2.7) and FSS 0.6 (0.5) vs. 1.6 (0.5) at 2 weeks, and DSRS 3.0 (1.4) vs. 9.0 (3.7) at hospital discharge or death. Cerebellar rTMS is a feasible ward-based treatment for reducing swallowing impairment. Although enrolment was lower than desired, there was evidence for proof of concept, particularly for high-intensity cerebellar rTMS. Larger studies are warranted.\n",

Emerging resistances to beta-lactams in this species complicates potential treatment since it is intrinsically resistant to colistin. Eleven isolates of carbapenem-non-susceptible <i>P. mirabilis</i> were identified in Sousse Hospital, Tunisia, from January 2018 to December 2022. MICs were determined and isolates were sequenced to determine their resistomes, sequence types, virulence factors, and their clonal relationships. Susceptibility testing showed that all isolates were resistant to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, chloramphenicol, and the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole combination. They remained susceptible to the aztreonam/avibactam combination. All isolates produced NDM-1 carbapenemase and ArmA 16S rRNA methylase. In addition, one isolate co-produced the <i>bla</i><sub>VEB-6</sub> gene. All isolates belonged to ST135, and phylogenetic analysis revealed that they were closely related.

            "The human microbiome plays a vital role in maintaining human homeostasis, acting as a key regulator of host immunity and defense mechanisms. However, dysbiotic microbial communities may cause disruption of the symbiotic relationship between the host and the local microbiota, leading to the pathogenesis of various diseases, including viral infections and cancers. One of the most common infectious agents causing cancer is the human papilloma virus (HPV), which accounts for more than 90% of cervical cancers. In most cases, the host immune system is activated and clears HPV, whereas in some cases, the infection persists and can lead to precancerous lesions. Over the last two decades, the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology and bioinformatics has allowed a thorough and in-depth analysis of the microbial composition in various anatomical niches, allowing researchers to unveil the interactions and the underlying mechanisms through which the human microbiota could affect HPV infection establishment, persistence, and progression. Accordingly, the present narrative review aims to shed light on our understanding of the role of the human microbiome in the context of HPV infection and its progression, mainly to cervical cancer. Furthermore, we explore the mechanisms by which the composition and balance of microbial communities exert potential pathogenic or protective effects, leading to either HPV persistence and disease outcomes or clearance. Special interest is given to how the microbiome can modulate host immunity to HPV infection. Lastly, we summarize the latest findings on the therapeutic efficacy of probiotics and prebiotics in preventing and/or treating HPV infections and the potential of vaginal microbiota transplantation while highlighting the significance of personalized medicine approaches emerging from NGS-based microbiome profiling and artificial intelligence (AI) for the optimal management of HPV-related diseases.\n",

            "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant cause of respiratory infections in adults, particularly among older adults and individuals with chronic diseases. While traditionally linked to pediatric populations, RSV's impact on adults, especially the elderly, is increasingly recognized but remains understudied in many regions. This retrospective study, conducted at the University Hospital Center Zagreb from October 2022 to April 2024, is the first to analyze RSV-positive adults in Croatia. Using RT-PCR testing, we evaluated clinical and epidemiological characteristics in both hospitalized and outpatient populations, focusing on those aged &gt; 65 years. Among 2631 tested individuals, the RSV prevalence was 5.25%, with older adults experiencing the most severe outcomes, including pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, and intensive care admissions. Seasonal analysis confirmed a winter peak in RSV cases, while chronic conditions such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases were strongly associated with higher complication rates. These findings demonstrate that older adults with comorbidities bear the greatest burden of RSV infection, highlighting the need for the early identification of high-risk patients. By providing detailed insights into RSV-related outcomes in this population, this study supports the development of targeted prevention and management strategies to reduce the burden of RSV in vulnerable groups.\n",

            "Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 has been traditionally linked to poultry and wild birds, which has recently become a serious concern for dairy cattle, causing outbreaks all over the United States. The need for improved surveillance, biosecurity protocols, and interagency collaboration is highlighted by the discovery of H5N1 in dairy herds in several states and its human transmission. The epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and wide-ranging effects of H5N1 in cattle are reviewed in this paper, with particular attention paid to the disease's effects on agricultural systems, public health, and animal health. Nonspecific clinical symptoms, such as decreased milk production and irregular milk consistency, are indicative of infection in dairy cows. Alarmingly, significant virus loads have been discovered in raw milk, raising worries about potential zoonotic transmission. The dangers of viral spillover between species are further highlighted by cases of domestic cats experiencing severe neurological symptoms after ingesting raw colostrum and milk from infected cows. Even though human cases remain rare, and they are mostly related to occupational exposure, constant attention is required due to the possibility of viral adaptability. The necessity of a One Health approach that integrates environmental, animal, and human health efforts is further supported by the broad occurrence of H5N1 across multiple species. For early detection, containment, and mitigation, cooperation between veterinary clinics, public health organizations, and agricultural stakeholders is crucial. Controlling the outbreak requires stringent movement restrictions, regular testing of dairy cows in reference labs, and adherence to biosecurity procedures. This review highlights the importance of thorough and coordinated efforts to manage H5N1 in dairy cattle by combining existing knowledge and pointing out gaps in surveillance and response strategies. Additionally, it sheds light on the potential risk of consumption of cow's milk contaminated with H5N1 virus by humans and other companion animals like cats. In the face of this changing threat, proactive monitoring, strict biosecurity protocols, and cross-sector cooperation are crucial for reducing financial losses and protecting human and animal health.\n",

            "We performed a comprehensive structural analysis of the conformational space of several spike (S) protein variants using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Specifically, we examined four well-known variants (Delta, BA.1, XBB.1.5, and JN.1) alongside the wild-type (WT) form of SARS-CoV-2. The conformational states of each variant were characterized by analyzing their distributions within a selected space of collective variables (CVs), such as inter-domain distances between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD). Our primary focus was to identify conformational states relevant to potential structural transitions and to determine the set of native contacts (NCs) that stabilize these conformations. The results reveal that genetically more distant variants, such as XBB.1.5, BA.1, and JN.1, tend to adopt more compact conformational states compared to the WT. Additionally, these variants exhibit novel NC profiles, characterized by an increased number of specific contacts distributed among ionic, polar, and nonpolar residues. We further analyzed the impact of specific mutations, including T478K, N500Y, and Y504H. These mutations not only enhance interactions with the human host receptor but also alter inter-chain stability by introducing additional NCs compared to the WT. Consequently, these mutations may influence the accessibility of certain protein regions to neutralizing antibodies. Overall, these findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the structural and functional variations among S protein variants.\n",

To understand the risks for animal and human health and to mitigate the impact of future outbreaks, comprehensive viral surveillance in vertebrate hosts and vectors is needed. We conducted the first serosurvey for the WNV in ruminants in southern Tunisia using the ELISA test and confirmed it with the micro-virus neutralization test (VNT). Antibodies were detected by the ELISA test in camels (38/112), sheep (9/155), and goats (7/58), and six samples were doubtful (five camels and one sheep). The ELISA positive and doubtful sera (<i>n</i> = 60) were further analyzed to confirm the presence of specific anti-WNV and anti-Usutu virus (USUV) antibodies using the micro-virus neutralization test (VNT). Out of the 60 sera, 33 were confirmed for specific WNV antibodies, with an overall seroprevalence of 10.15% [95% CI: 7.09-13.96]. The high seroprevalence observed in camels (22.3%) suggests their potential use as sentinel animals for WNV surveillance in southern Tunisia. The viral genome, and consequently active circulation, could not be detected by real-time RT-qPCR in blood samples. Ongoing surveillance of the WNV in animals, including camels, sheep, and goats, may be used for the early detection of viral circulation and for a rapid response to mitigate potential outbreaks in horses and humans.\n",

            "Hybrid capture-based target enrichment prior to sequencing has been shown to significantly improve the sensitivity of detection for genetic regions of interest. In the context of One Health relevant pathogen detection, we present a hybrid capture-based sequencing method that employs an optimized probe set consisting of 149,990 probes, targeting 663 viruses associated with humans and animals. The detection performance was initially assessed using viral reference materials in a background of human nucleic acids. Compared to standard metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), our method achieved substantial read enrichment, with increases ranging from 143- to 1126-fold, and enhanced detection sensitivity by lowering the limit of detection (LoD) from 10<sup>3</sup>-10<sup>4</sup> copies to as few as 10 copies based on whole genomes. This method was further validated using infectious samples from both animals and humans, including bovine rectal swabs and throat swabs from SARS-CoV-2 patients across various concentration gradients. In both sample types, our hybrid capture-based sequencing method exhibited heightened sensitivity, increased viral genome coverage, and more comprehensive viral identification and characterization. Our method bridges a critical divide between diagnostic detection and genomic surveillance. These findings illustrate that our hybrid capture-based sequencing method can effectively enhance sensitivity to as few as 10 viral copies and genome coverage to &gt;99% in medium-to-high viral loads. This dual capability is particularly impactful for emerging pathogens like SARS-CoV-2, where early detection and genomic characterization are equally vital, thereby addressing the limitations of metagenomics in the surveillance of emerging infectious diseases in complex samples.\n",

Observational and basic studies have demonstrated a strong link between host nutrient status and anti-viral immune responses, and nutritional supplements were shown to improve the prognosis of viral infectious diseases. However, there is limited research on the relationship between essential micronutrients and the susceptibility to viral pneumonia. In addition, current studies are often confounded by biases and reverse causality, undermining their reliability. In this study, to fill the gap, we employed Mendelian randomization to investigate the causal relationship between supplementation of vitamins and minerals and the susceptibility to viral pneumonia. Our analysis found that vitamin B6 is a protective factor against viral pneumonia, while selenium supplementation is a risk factor. These findings provide insights for the use of dietary supplements and the prevention and control of viral pneumonia, especially when micronutrient supplementation is used as an adjunctive therapy for viral infections.\n",

            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel human coronavirus, emerged in late 2019 and rapidly evolved into a pandemic around the world. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically changed the epidemiology and seasonality of other traditional respiratory viruses, e.g., influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, enterovirus, etc. These traditional respiratory viruses have transmission mode and clinical symptoms similar to SARS-CoV-2 but may differ in clinical outcomes and management. Co-infection between SARS-CoV-2 and one or more traditional respiratory viruses have been reported in the literature but have shown mixed evidence in clinical outcomes. With SARS-CoV-2 evolving into mild Omicron variants, it is believed that SARS-CoV-2 co-circulates with other respiratory viruses, which in turn affect the epidemiology and clinical course of respiratory viral infections. In response to these changes, multiplex molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 and one or more traditional respiratory viruses are attracting more attention in the field and have been developed into a variety of testing modalities. In this review, we describe the seasonality (i.e., in the Northern Hemisphere), epidemiology, and clinical significance of traditional respiratory viruses and their co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the post-COVID era. Furthermore, we review commonly used multiplex molecular tests and their applications for the detection of respiratory viruses and their co-infections. Altogether, this review not only sheds light on the epidemiology and clinical significance of respiratory viral infections and co-infections in the post-COVID era, and but also provides insights into the laboratory-based diagnoses of respiratory viral infections using multiplex molecular testing.\n",

            "Globally, an estimated 254 million people are living with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, yet only 10.5% have been diagnosed, underscoring the urgent need to expand testing to meet the World Health Organization's HBV elimination targets by 2030. Many HBV diagnostic tests remain expensive and inaccessible in resource-limited settings. In this study, we demonstrate how individually sourced, commercially available reagents can be used to develop cost-effective in-house assays for total DNA isolation, HBV viral load quantification by (q)PCR, and qHBsAg and qHBeAg measurement using sandwich ELISA. These assays were validated using known HBV-positive and HBV-negative plasma samples (genotypes A-F) and HepAD38 cells treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). DNA isolation using a commercial column-based kit was compared to a high-throughput, column-free method, allowing for HBV quantification from 50 &#xb5;L of plasma with lower limits of detection (LLOD) of 1.8 &#xd7; 10<sup>3</sup> and 1.8 &#xd7; 10<sup>4</sup> HBV DNA copies IU/mL, respectively. Both commercial and in-house DNA isolation methods yielded comparable half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) values in TDF-treated HepAD38 cells. Additionally, in-house sandwich ELISA assays were developed for quantitative HBsAg and HBeAg detection, with LLOD values of 0.78 IU/mL and 0.38 PEI U/mL (Paul Ehrlich Institute), respectively. The in-house reagents for DNA isolation, molecular testing, and serological detection of HBV were estimated to be at least 10 times more cost-effective than commercially available kits, highlighting their potential for broader application in resource-limited regions.\n",

            "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a class of non-coding RNAs. In the study of <i>Pseudomonas putida</i> Sneb821-induced tomato resistance to <i>Meloidogyne incognita</i>, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to validate 12 lncRNAs in tomato. Among them, the lncRNA47258/miR319b/TCP molecular regulatory module was likely implicated in the process of Sneb821-induced tomato resistance against <i>M. incognita</i>. Through the application of tomato hairy root and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) technologies for the investigation of lncRNA47258, it was determined that lncRNA47258 could target the <i>TCP</i> (<i>Solyc07g062681.1</i>) gene and modulate the metabolic pathway of tomato jasmonic acid-related indices, thereby impeding the infection of <i>M. incognita</i>. Moreover, the overexpression of the target gene <i>TCP</i> (<i>Solyc07g062681.1</i>) using tomato hairy root technology demonstrated that it could regulate the jasmonic acid synthesis pathway in tomato, consequently obstructing the infection and suppressing the development of <i>M. incognita</i>. Collectively, lncRNA47258/miR319b/<i>TCP</i> (<i>Solyc07g062681.1</i>) was preliminarily verified to be involved in the Sneb821-induced resistance process against <i>M. incognita</i> in tomato.\n",

            "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), caused by infection with the SFTS virus, is an emerging fatal tick-borne zoonosis endemic to East Asia. Although SFTS is a tick-borne disease, the virus can be transmitted from animals with SFTS without a tick bite. Direct transmission of the SFTS virus from animals to humans has been reported; however, the transmission route is unclear in some cases. Therefore, this study focused on the possibility of SFTS virus transmission through urine and attempted to isolate the infectious virus from the urine of animals with SFTS. Since more efficient cell isolation is needed to determine whether the SFTS virus is present, we first expressed dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), the major receptor for the virus, in Vero cells (Vero-DC-SIGN cells) using a retroviral vector. When inoculated with equal amounts of the SFTS virus strain and SFTS-virus-infected animal serum, Vero-DC-SIGN cells had 42-136% and 20-85% more foci, respectively, than their parent Vero cells. After confirming that Vero-DC-SIGN cells were more suitable for the isolation of the SFTS virus, we investigated whether it could be isolated from the urine of eight cats and two dogs with SFTS. The virus was isolated from 25 &#x3bc;L of urine from two cats with SFTS. Considering that cats excrete 50-100 mL of urine per day, the transmission of the SFTS virus via the urine of cats with SFTS cannot be ruled out. Individuals examining or caring for cats suspected of having SFTS should be aware of the possibility of viral transmission via urine.\n",

            "Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) encode viral G-protein-coupled receptors (vGPCRs) that have diverged from their cellular homologues to perform new functions. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes four vGPCRs: UL33, UL78, US27, and US28, which contribute to viral pathogenesis, cellular signalling, and latency. While the role of US28 in chemokine signalling and viral latency is well characterised, the functions of other vGPCRs remain incompletely understood. Rodent cytomegaloviruses only have homologues to UL33 and UL78, while primates have two to five additional GPCRs which are homologues of US27 and US28. Different CMVs appear to have evolved vGPCRs with functions specific to infection of their respective host. As non-human CMVs are used as model organisms to understand clinical cytomegalovirus disease and develop vaccines and antivirals, understanding the differences between these vGPCRs helps researchers understand critical differences between their models. This review aims to address the differences between CMV vGPCRs, and how these differences may affect models of CMV disease to facilitate future research.\n",

These individuals face healthcare barriers, necessitating innovative diagnostic tools. This study evaluated the impact of cobas plasma separation cards (PSCs) for dry plasma collection in Barcelona's outpatient drug addiction centers (CAS). From February to December 2021, nine CASs were invited to implement PSC for HCV screening; three centers participated, allowing for the assessment of its impact on HCV detection. Of the 679 clients screened, 54 (8%) provided finger-prick blood samples via PSC due to their refusal or inability to undergo venipuncture. Overall, 100 (14.7%) clients tested positive for HCV antibodies, with 24 (24%) confirmed as HCV-RNA positive. Among venipuncture clients, 9.1% had positive antibodies, with 15.8% showing active infection. In contrast, 79.6% of PSC clients had positive antibodies and 34.9% had detectable HCV RNA, contributing to 62.5% of the active infections detected. The odds ratio was 26.3, indicating that refusal or inability to undergo venipuncture correlated with a significantly higher burden of active HCV infection. The findings highlight PSC as a valuable alternative for diagnosing HCV in people with substance use disorders, addressing accessibility barriers and improving linkage to care in high-risk populations.\n",

            "Neurological complications associated with influenza (NCIs) are rare events in adults. Influenza-associated encephalopathy is one of the most severe and frequently reported NCIs. The aim of this study is to describe the frequency and characteristics of NCIs in adults during 10 post-2009 pandemic influenza seasons. Data were obtained from the registry of influenza cases admitted to hospitals of the PIDIRAC network for the surveillance of severe hospitalized laboratory-confirmed influenza (SHLCI) cases in Catalonia from October 2010 to March 2020. The variables analyzed were NCI, age, antiviral treatment, vaccination status, and outcome at discharge. During the study period, 9 (1.5&#x2031;) of 5931 SHLCI cases presented NCI. Five (55.6%) had influenza A and four (44.4%) had influenza B. Median age was 62 (17-67) years. One case had been vaccinated, all had received antiviral treatment, and five required ICU admission. The mean length of stay was 25.6 days (SD 25.8). Encephalitis was the most frequent complication, occurring in six cases (66.7%). Of these, three cases (50%) were caused by influenza A (two AH1N1pdm09 strains and one AH3N2). The high frequency of influenza-associated encephalitis caused by both type A and B influenza viruses suggests that both should be considered as potential etiologic factors for encephalopathy and other neurological diseases in adults. This recommendation would allow for the prompt antiviral treatment and prevention of severe outcomes.\n",

This review aims to give an insight into recent data about the structure and genomic organization, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and current treatment options of BKPyV infections in children after HSCT. News regarding viral replication and pathogenesis include the generation of miRNA, new mechanisms of viral shedding by releasing infectious particles via extracellular vesicles, and human bladder microvascular endothelial cells probably acting as viral reservoirs enabling low-level viral replication and persistence. In studies conducted over the past five years, BKPyV hemorrhagic cystitis (BKPyV-HC) has a prevalence rate of 4 to 27% in children undergoing HSCT. Diagnostics still has unsolved dilemmas like whole blood or plasma samples as well as the standardization of molecular methods to allow for reporting in international units. In terms of treatment, new approaches have been used in the past five years, including the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), virus-specific T cells (VSTs), and recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor (rH-KGF), although the efficacy of some of these treatments has only been documented in isolated studies. This complication continues to pose a substantial clinical challenge, characterized by an absence of effective preventive and therapeutic measures.\n",

            "Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are known to impact cellular and humoral immune response in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). In this study, we performed in-depth SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell profiling using flow cytometry. T-cell immunity in pwMS with or without DMTs was evaluated before a first SARS-CoV-2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccination and at one-, two- and six-month follow-up. T-cell stimulation without SARS-CoV-2-specific antigens was used as a control. T-cell response was compared to B-cell response by evaluating SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. We observed an upregulation of specific subpopulations of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Thus, our results demonstrate the induction of a broad and distinct CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response in pwMS even on anti-CD20 treatment and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulation after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. This was particularly seen in CD4<sup>+high</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD154<sup>+</sup> T cells. Our results do not support the induction of a CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell immune response. While humoral immune response was impaired in pwMS during ocrelizumab and fingolimod treatment, there was evidence of a compensatory upregulation of subpopulations of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at low levels of seroconversion in pwMS. In conclusion, our results provide important insights into the mechanisms of the adaptive immune response in pwMS following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination.\n",

            "HIV-1 infection cannot be cured due to the presence of HIV-1 latently infected cells. These cells do not produce the virus, but they can resume virus production at any time in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. Therefore, people living with HIV (PLWH) need to take lifelong therapy. Strategies have been coined to eradicate the viral reservoir by reactivating HIV-1 latently infected cells and subsequently killing them. Various latency reversing agents (LRAs) that can reactivate HIV-1 in vitro and ex vivo have been identified. The most potent LRAs also strongly activate T cells and therefore cannot be applied in vivo. Many LRAs that reactivate HIV in the absence of general T cell activation have been identified and have been tested in clinical trials. Although some LRAs could reduce the reservoir size in clinical trials, so far, they have failed to eradicate the reservoir. More recently, immune modulators have been applied in PLWH, and the first results seem to indicate that these may reduce the reservoir and possibly improve immunological control after therapy interruption. Potentially, combinations of LRAs and immune modulators could reduce the reservoir size, and in the future, immunological control may enable PLWH to live without developing HIV-related disease in the absence of therapy.\n",

The findings revealed that advanced age, cardiovascular disease, and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines significantly heightened the risks of severe complications and mortality. Conversely, low IgG levels correlated with prolonged hospital stays and slower recovery. Multivariate analysis identified high IL-6 and TNF-&#x3b1; levels as strong predictors of adverse outcomes. This research emphasizes the need for the early monitoring of cytokines and targeted management strategies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, especially among high-risk unvaccinated populations.\n",

As northern Italy, especially the Veneto Region, is considered an endemic area for WNV and USUV circulation, a surveillance plan based on a One Health approach has been implemented since 2008. This work reports the results of entomological, veterinary and human surveillances for WNV and USUV in the Veneto Region in 2022 and 2023, through virological and/or serological examinations. In 2022, 531 human WNV infections were recorded, and 93,213 mosquitoes and 2193 birds were virologically tested, showing infection rates (IRs) of 4.85% and 8.30%, respectively. The surveillance effort in 2023 provided these results: 56 human WNV infections were confirmed, and 133,648 mosquitoes and 1812 birds were virologically tested, showing IRs of 1.78% and 4.69%, respectively. This work highlights the exceptional circulation of WNV in the Veneto Region, due to the new re-introduction of WNV lineage 1 and co-circulation with WNV lineage 2. This paper confirms the efficacy of integrated surveillance for early warning of viral circulation and gives new insights about avian hosts involved in the enzootic cycle of orthoflavivirus in the endemic region of Italy.\n",

            "Despite the availability of excellent HPV-specific vaccines, HPV-related conditions and, notably, their related neoplastic diseases are expected to impact human health for many years to come. Polyphenols and flavonoids are a large class of natural products, credited with a wide range of pharmacological properties including antineoplastic activity. However, the currently available data depict a rather heterogeneous and sometimes contradictory landscape, and no univocal conclusions can be drawn. To shed light on such a controversial issue, a restricted list of promising polyphenols were evaluated for their antineoplastic activity on HPV-transformed cells. Among them, Kaempferol, Galangin, and Luteolin proved to have distinct anti-clonal activity with ID<sub>50</sub> values, respectively, of 1.25, 6.25, and 3.0 microMolar, and three other compounds, namely, Chrysin, Quercetin, and Apigenin, showed fair although less intense activity with ID values, respectively, of 25.0, 40, and 25 microMolar. Interestingly, a distinct anti-proliferative effect could also be suggested for Kaempferol, Luteolin, and Apigenine. Cooperative anti-clonal effects could be suggested for binary and ternary compositions made of Kaepferol, Galangin, and Luteolin once combined at concentrations ranging from 2 to 8 microMolar. At these concentrations, the single components and the triple combination induced distinct cell cycle modulation associated with marked restoration of the p53 and p21Cip1/Waf1 levels, consistent with the disruption of the E6/E6AP interaction whose continuous activity is necessary for both the induction and maintenance of the viral-induced neoplastic phenotype.\n",

While <i>C. belli</i> was detected in 4.2% (<i>n</i> = 25) of the assessed HIV-positive patients, this was the case for only 1 (1.2%) Ghanaian control individuum without known HIV infection. Associations of cystoisosporiasis in Ghanaian HIV patients with reduced CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts and increased HIV viral loads, immune-activation as indicated by reduced CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocyte ratios as well as higher expression of HLA-DR+ CD38+ on CD4+ T-lymphocytes, a symptom complex comprising diarrhea, weight loss and a reduced BMI, a trend towards not being on antiretroviral medication, and lacking access to food safety procedures like storing food in refrigerators were shown. The odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of the associations were 4.47 (1.52-12.09) for the abundance of <i>C. belli</i> DNA and clinical diarrhea, 3.51 (1.42-9.12) for the abundance of <i>C. belli</i> DNA and CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts &lt;200 cells/&#xb5;L, and 3.66 (1.52-9.01) for the abundance of <i>C. belli</i> DNA and not having a refrigerator in the household. In conclusion, the assessment contributed to existing insight into the epidemiology of cystoisosporiasis in immunosuppressed individuals in resource-limited tropical high-endemicity areas. Chronic diarrhea among people living with HIV should prompt a diagnostic assessment for confirmation or exclusion of <i>C. belli</i> infections in such settings.\n",

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of these infections and their associated risk factors in survivors from the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. This retrospective cross-sectional study reviewed 1957 medical records of survivors of sexual violence who received care at two large healthcare facilities in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa between January 2019 and December 2020. All survivors were screened for HBV, HIV, and syphilis infections. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with HIV and syphilis infections. The overall seroprevalence rates for HBV, syphilis, and HIV were 0.7%, 4.9%, and 17.3%, respectively. Six individuals were co-infected with at least two of these infections. Predictors for HIV infection included age (age &lt; 16: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-0.08 and ages 16-25: aOR 0.45; 95% CI, 0.34-0.59) and black race (aOR 4.78; 95% CI, 1.09-20.88).

            "The presentation of HIV peptides by the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex to CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) is critical to limit viral pathogenesis. HIV can mutate to evade HLA-restricted CTL responses and resist antiretroviral drugs, raising questions about how it balances these evolutionary pressures. Here, we used a computational approach to assess how drug resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) affect the binding of HIV-1 subtype B or C peptides to the most prevalent HLA alleles in US, European, and South African populations. We predict RAMs that may be favored in certain populations and report the under-representation of Y181C in people expressing HLA-B*57:01. This finding agreed with our computational predictions when Y181C was at the major anchor site P2, suggesting the potential relevance of our approach. Overall, our findings lay out a conceptual framework to study the implications of HLA alleles on the emergence of HIV RAMs at the individual and population levels.\n",

Epidemiological studies showed a reduced risk of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity with the practice of regular physical activity (PA) in clinical populations. Here, we investigated the effect of PA against COVID-19 in a young general population. <b>Methods</b>: Two hundred ninety volunteers over 18 years old from Reunion Island responded to an online survey concerning sociodemographic, lifestyle and clinical information. Daily PA was studied using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short version (IPAQ) and classified by overall score and intensities of PA. <b>Results</b>: Among 290 responders [179 women, median age = 27.5 years (interquartile range = 21.3 years)], 141 (48.6%) reported COVID-19 infection. Multivariate logistic analysis adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, chronic disease and alcohol consumption showed that the number of days per week of regular intense PA was independently associated with a low risk of COVID-19 infection [odds ratio (OR) 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 0.99; <i>p</i> = 0.030], while regular moderate PA was not [OR 1.10; 95%CI 0.97 to 1.23; <i>p</i> = 0.137]. <b>Conclusions</b>: In a population of young adults, regular intense PA could offer a protective effect against COVID-19.

This study explores the bioactivity of fungal strains isolated from MPs in Mediterranean sediments, focusing on their osteogenic and antiviral activities. Crude extracts prepared via solid-state and submerged-state fermentation were tested for their effects on extracellular matrix mineralization in vitro and bone growth in zebrafish larvae, and for their activity against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). Several extracts exhibited significant mineralogenic and osteogenic activities, with <i>Aspergillus jensenii</i> MUT6581 and <i>Cladosporium halotolerans</i> MUT6558 being the most performing ones. Antiviral assays identified extracts from <i>A. jensenii</i> MUT6581 and <i>Bjerkandera adusta</i> MUT6589 as effective against RSV and HSV-2 at different extents, with no cytotoxic effect. Although chemical profiling of <i>A. jensenii</i> MUT6581 extract led to the isolation of decumbenones A and B, they did not reproduce the observed bioactivities, suggesting the involvement of other active compounds or synergistic effects. These results highlight the plastisphere as a valuable resource for novel bioactive compounds and suggest the need for further fractionation and characterization to identify the molecules responsible for these promising activities.\n",

            "Acute respiratory viral infections (ARIs) represent a significant global health challenge, contributing heavily to worldwide morbidity and mortality rates. Recent efforts to combat ARIs have focused on developing nasal spray formulations that effectively target the nasal mucosa. However, challenges such as irritation, discomfort, and safety concerns highlight the need for natural, eco-friendly ingredients. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of solubilized sturgeon oil (SSO), prepared as an oil-in-water nanoemulsion from Siberian sturgeon, as an eco-friendly preventive nasal spray agent against ARIs. Intranasal pre-treatment with SSO effectively inhibited respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus (IAV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Additionally, it suppressed viral replication in both nasal and lung tissues. This antiviral effect was linked to reduced pulmonary inflammation, characterized by decreased infiltration of Ly-6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes and Ly-6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophils, along with lower pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Histopathological analyses confirmed that nasal SSO administration significantly mitigated lung inflammation progression caused by viral infections. Notably, the protective effects of SSO against SARS-CoV-2, IAV, and RSV persisted for at least six hours following nasal application. These findings highlight SSO as a promising eco-friendly and safe candidate for nasal spray formulations, providing a potential frontline defense against ARIs.\n",

            "Viral infectious diseases pose a serious threat to global public health due to their high transmissibility, rapid mutation rates, and limited treatment options. Recent outbreaks of diseases such as plague, monkeypox, avian influenza, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have underscored the urgent need for efficient diagnostic and surveillance technologies. Focusing on viral infectious diseases that seriously threaten human health, this review summarizes and analyzes detection techniques from the perspective of combining viral surveillance and prevention advice, and discusses applications in improving diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. One of the major innovations of this review is the systematic integration of advanced biorecognition and detection technologies, such as bionanosensors, rapid detection test strips, and microfluidic platforms, along with the exploration of artificial intelligence in virus detection. These technologies address the limitations of traditional methods and enable the real-time monitoring and early warning of viral outbreaks. By analyzing the application of these technologies in the detection of pathogens, new insights are provided for the development of next-generation diagnostic tools to address emerging and re-emerging viral threats. In addition, we analyze the current progress of developed vaccines, combining virus surveillance with vaccine research to provide new ideas for future viral disease prevention and control and vaccine development, and call for global attention and the development of new disease prevention and detection technologies.\n",

            "The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the global necessity to develop fast, affordable, and user-friendly diagnostic alternatives. Alongside recognized tests such as ELISA, nanotechnologies have since been explored for direct and indirect diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. Accordingly, in this work, we report a method to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies based on graphene-based field-effect transistors (GFETs), using a nanostructured platform of graphene with added gold nanorods (GNRs) and a specific viral protein. To detect anti-N-protein IgG antibodies for COVID-19 in human sera, gold nanorods were functionalized with the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2, and subsequently deposited onto graphene devices. Our test results demonstrate that the sensor is highly sensitive and can detect antibody concentrations as low as 100 pg/mL. Using the sensor to test human sera that were previously diagnosed with ELISA showed a 90% accuracy rate compared to the ELISA results, with the test completed in under 15 min. Integrating graphene and nanorods eliminates the need for a blocker, simplifying sensor fabrication. This hybrid sensor holds robust potential to serve as a simple and efficient point-of-care platform.\n",

            "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. The etiology of HCC has now dramatically changed from viral hepatitis to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). The main pathogenesis of MASLD-related HCC is the hepatic lipid accumulation of hepatocytes, which causes chronic inflammation and the subsequent progression of hepatic fibrosis. Chronic hepatic inflammation generates oxidative stress and DNA damage in hepatocytes, which contribute to genomic instability, resulting in the development of HCC. Several metabolic and molecular pathways are also linked to chronic inflammation and HCC in MASLD. In particular, the MAPK and PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathways are upregulated in MASLD, promoting the survival and proliferation of HCC cells. In addition, MASLD has been reported to enhance the development of HCC in patients with chronic viral hepatitis infection. Although there is no approved medication for MASLD besides resmetirom in the USA, there are some preventive strategies for the onset and progression of HCC. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, a class of medications, has been reported to exert anti-tumor effects on HCC by regulating metabolic reprogramming. Moreover, CD34-positive cell transplantation improves hepatic fibrosis by promoting intrahepatic angiogenesis and supplying various growth factors. Furthermore, exercise improves MASLD through an increase in energy consumption as well as changes in chemokines and myokines. In this review, we summarize the recent progress made in the pathogenic mechanisms of MASLD-associated HCC. Furthermore, we introduced new therapeutic strategies for preventing the development of HCC based on the pathogenesis of MASLD.\n",

            "Respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), continue to impose a heavy global health burden. Despite existing vaccination programs, these infections remain leading causes of morbidity and mortality, especially among vulnerable populations like children, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals. However, the current therapeutic options for respiratory viral infections are often limited to supportive care, underscoring the need for novel treatment strategies. Autophagy, particularly macroautophagy, has emerged as a fundamental cellular process in the host response to respiratory viral infections. This process not only supports cellular homeostasis by degrading damaged organelles and pathogens but also enables xenophagy, which selectively targets viral particles for degradation and enhances cellular defense. However, viruses have evolved mechanisms to manipulate the autophagy pathways, using them to evade immune detection and promote viral replication. This review examines the dual role of autophagy in viral manipulation and host defense, focusing on the complex interplay between respiratory viruses and autophagy-related pathways. By elucidating these mechanisms, we aim to highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting autophagy to enhance antiviral responses, offering promising directions for the development of effective treatments against respiratory viral infections.\n",

            "Pulmonary fibrosis due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the leading cause of death in patients with COVID-19. &#x3b2;-catenin, a key molecule in the Wnt/&#x3b2;-catenin signaling pathway, has been shown to be involved in the development of pulmonary fibrosis (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, silicosis). In this study, we developed a SARS-CoV-2-infected A549-hACE2 cell model to evaluate the efficacy of the A549-hACE2 monoclonal cell line against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The A549-hACE2 cells were then subjected to either knockdown or overexpression of the effector &#x3b2;-catenin, and the modified cells were subsequently infected with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we employed transcriptomics and raw letter analysis approaches to investigate other potential effects of &#x3b2;-catenin on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We successfully established a model of cellular fibrosis induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung-derived cells. This model can be utilized to investigate the molecular biological mechanisms and cellular signaling pathways associated with virus-induced lung fibrosis. The results of our mechanistic studies indicate that &#x3b2;-catenin plays a significant role in lung fibrosis resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the inhibition of &#x3b2;-catenin mitigated the accumulation of mesenchymal stroma in A549-hACE2 cells. Additionally, &#x3b2;-catenin knockdown was found to facilitate multi-pathway crosstalk following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The fact that &#x3b2;-catenin overexpression did not exacerbate cellular fibrosis may be attributed to the activation of PPP2R2B.\n",

            "Over the past decade, there has been a notable increase in the utilization of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer care, transforming the therapeutic landscape for several types of solid tumors. This development has not only expanded the indications for treatment but has also significantly influenced management strategies and prognostic outcomes for specific subsets of cancer patients. In contrast to the general population of cancer patients, individuals diagnosed with both HIV and cancer encounter significant differences in treatment approaches and outcomes. Consequently, this population demonstrates a significantly increased rate of specific mortality for several common types of cancer. Recent studies have reported significant insights into the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors among this patient group. However, the data remain insufficient, and there are still recognized barriers and limitations regarding the use of these agents in cancer patients. Real-world data and reports from clinical practice offer critical perspectives, enabling the sharing of clinical experiences and assisting in navigating complex management decisions. This report outlines two cases of patients with concurrent HIV and cancer who were administered ICIs in diverse clinical settings, highlighting the necessity of cooperation between oncologists and HIV specialists to provide patients with cutting-edge and increasingly tailored treatment options.\n",

This study aimed to detect the occurrence of carbapenemase- and carbapenem-resistant-encoding genes in K. pneumoniae isolates from COVID-19 positive and negative patients, and to assess their impact on patient outcomes. A prospective analysis was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia, collecting 97 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) isolates from patients with COVID-19 during 2020-2021. Isolates were obtained from various clinical specimens. Antimicrobial susceptibility assays were performed using the Automated Vitek-2 system, and data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics. The predominant carbapenemases identified were Oxacillinase-48 (OXA-48), followed by KPC and New Delhi metallo-&#x3b2;-lactamase (NDM), with Imipenemase (IMP) and Verona integron-encoded metallo-&#x3b2;-lactamase (VIM) being the least prevalent. COVID-19 did not significantly affect the distribution of these genes (P&gt;0.05); however, COVID-19 status and age over 60 years significantly impacted the outcomes of CRKP patients. Other factors such as gender, total ICU or ward stay, and comorbidities did not significantly affect CRKP infection outcomes. The most common carbapenem-resistant genes identified were blaKPC, blaNDM, and blaOXA-48; however, they were not significantly associated with increased mortality.\n",

The present study evaluated the prevalence of secondary fungal infections in critically ill patients with COVID-19. This is a retrospective, single-center study conducted in a hospital in northeastern Brazil, which evaluated 1,364 medical records of patients admitted to a COVID-19 ICU during 2020 and 2021. A total of 327 pathogenic yeasts were isolated from 132 (40.4%) respiratory, 70 (21.4%) blood, 124 (37.9%) urine, and one (0.3%) surgical wound samples. Fungal infections were diagnosed in the intermediate (5 to 12 days) or late (&#x2265;12 days) stage of hospitalization. The most frequent yeast isolated from critically ill COVID-19 patients was Candida albicans [126 (67.7%) and 60 (42.6%)], followed by Candida tropicalis [25 (13.4%) and 39 (27.7%)]. Candida parapsilosis isolates increased 5.7-fold in 2021 [40 (28.4%)] compared to 2020 [7 (3.8%)]. The least frequently isolated in 2020 and 2021 were Nakaseomyces glabratus [4 (2.2%) and 1 (0.7%)], and Pichia kudriavzevii, which was isolated only in 2021 (1 (0.7%)). During the study period, a decrease in susceptibility to antifungals was observed: susceptibility to voriconazole reduced from 100 to 77.2%, to flucytosine from 99.4 to 78.8%, and to micafungin from 99.4 to 83.6%. The changes in the frequency of species causing secondary infections in critically ill COVID-19 patients and susceptibility to the antifungals indicate the need for early and adequate diagnosis to minimize negative outcomes.\n",

A population-based, mixed ecological study of spatial and temporal trends, using secondary data from death certificate (DC) registries, in which hepatitis C was mentioned as an underlying or associated cause of mortality. Temporal trends were analyzed by joinpoint regression, and spatial analysis by the distribution of adjusted rates by age and sex, and spatial autocorrelation by the local Moran index and the Getis-Ord Gi* index (Gi star). From 2000 to 2020, 64,029 deaths due to hepatitis C were recorded in the Mortality Information System (SIM), representing 0.26% of deaths in Brazil. Most deaths were due to underlying causes (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;33,652, 52.6%). Areas with high rates in all five analyzed periods were identified in the states of S&#xe3;o Paulo, southern Minas Gerais, southern Rio de Janeiro, northern Paran&#xe1;, southern and coastal Santa Catarina, eastern Mato Grosso do Sul, and Rio Grande do Sul. The states of Acre and southern Amazonas showed high rates after 2004, which spread to northern Rond&#xf4;nia from 2016 to 2020. The joinpoint regression model showed an increasing trend in hepatitis C mortality in Brazil from 2000 to 2015, but a decreasing trend from 2016-2020. The mortality rate was higher in men and people over sixty years of age. Differences were observed in the temporal and spatial trend of hepatitis C mortality in different regions of Brazil. These data may support the design of hepatitis C elimination strategies in Brazil, according to regional specificities.\n",

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of the use of psychotropic medications among university students and evaluate the association of the use of such medicine with students who belong to minority groups. This is a cross-sectional study, in which all students enrolled in undergraduate courses at eight Brazilian public universities were invited to answer an online self-administered questionnaire. The data collection was conducted from October 2021 to February 2022. The outcome was the use of psychotropic medications and the explanatory variables were students who belong to minority groups, such as female, black, mixed-race, and other skin colors, and LGBTQIAPN+ individuals. The variables were descriptively analyzed and Pearson's chi-squared test and multinomial logistic regression were performed. A total of 8,650 students participated in the study, of which 25.7% reported using psychotropic medications in the 30 days prior to completing the questionnaire. It was observed that among students, female (OR = 1.8; 95%CI: 1.41-2.20) and non-heterosexual (OR = 1.5; 95%CI: 1.23-1.80) had higher chances of using psychotropic medications during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Here we describe a sentinel surveillance for anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology carried out on a cohort of 395 individuals at a Brazilian institution, from October 2020 to December 2022. A total of 1,507 serum samples were analyzed for IgG and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) or nucleocapsid (N) proteins, in the pre- and post-vaccination periods. The latter included two doses of CoronaVac (group 1, G1), or ChAdOx-1 or BNT162b2 (group 2, G2), followed by heterologous booster doses. In the pre-vaccination phase, 26.5% of the participants showed IgG reactivity for S and 13.7% for N. After the vaccines' first dose, S IgG response was positive in 66.6% or 98% of G1 or G2 participants, respectively, whereas 100% of the participants showed S IgG positivity after the second dose, and S IgG and IgA after the booster. This initiative enabled the examination of viral transmission beyond hospital environments, which has rarely been explored, and established protocols for managing future emergencies.

It involved research anchored in the theoretical frameworks of Critical Bioethics and was analyzed using qualitative methodology with a dialectical approach. The results demonstrate that during the period analyzed the Brazilian federal government acted in alignment with a \"major nebula\" that generated several bioethical conflicts. This nebula was sustained by an amalgam of interests of economic power, sectors of medical corporatism, and conservative political-ideological groups. On the other hand, the SBB and the entities of the Frente pela Vida articulated themselves as a \"counter-nebula\" of denunciation and resistance to bioethical conflicts. Considering that the attempt to act on the interests of the \"nebula\" persist, especially in the Brazilian State, the conclusion drawn is that the SBB and the entities of the Frente pela Vida must remain mobilized in social control, in the defense of the Unified Health System, democracy and human rights in the country.\n",

            "During the summer of 2024, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases surged globally, driven by variants derived from JN.1 subvariants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that feature new mutations, particularly in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein. In this study, we report on the neutralizing antibody (nAb) escape, infectivity, fusion, and spike stability of these subvariants-LB.1, KP.2.3, KP.3, and KP.3.1.1. Our findings demonstrate that all of these subvariants are highly evasive of nAbs elicited by the bivalent mRNA vaccine, the XBB.1.5 monovalent mumps virus-based vaccine, or from infections during the BA.2.86/JN.1 wave. This reduction in nAb titers is primarily driven by a single serine deletion (DelS31) in the NTD of the spike, leading to a distinct antigenic profile compared to the parental JN.1 and other variants. We also found that the DelS31 mutation decreases pseudovirus infectivity in CaLu-3 cells, which correlates with impaired cell-cell fusion. Additionally, the spike protein of DelS31 variants appears more conformationally stable, as indicated by reduced S1 shedding both with and without stimulation by soluble ACE2 and increased resistance to elevated temperatures. Molecular modeling suggests that DelS31 enhances the NTD-receptor-binding domain (RBD) interaction, favoring the RBD down conformation and reducing accessibility to ACE2 and specific nAbs. Moreover, DelS31 introduces an N-linked glycan at N30, shielding the NTD from antibody recognition. These findings underscore the role of NTD mutations in immune evasion, spike stability, and viral infectivity, highlighting the need to consider DelS31-containing antigens in updated COVID-19 vaccines.IMPORTANCEThe emergence of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants continues to pose challenges for global public health, particularly in the context of immune evasion and viral stability. This study identifies a key N-terminal domain (NTD) mutation, DelS31, in JN.1-derived subvariants that enhances neutralizing antibody escape while reducing infectivity and cell-cell fusion. The DelS31 mutation stabilizes the spike protein conformation, limits S1 shedding, and increases thermal resistance, which possibly contribute to prolonged viral persistence. Structural analyses reveal that DelS31 enhances NTD-receptor-binding domain interactions by introducing glycan shielding, thus decreasing antibody and ACE2 accessibility. These findings emphasize the critical role of NTD mutations in shaping viral evolution and immune evasion, underscoring the urgent need for updated coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines that account for these adaptive changes.\n",

            "People living with HIV (PLWH) exhibit accelerated aging, characterized by systemic inflammation, termed \"inflammaging.\" While T-cell expansion is prevalent in PLWH, its connection to inflammaging remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the TCR&#x3b2; repertoire of 257 healthy controls (HC) and 228 PLWH, revealing pronounced T cell clonal expansion in PLWH. The expansion was only partially reversed following antiretroviral therapy (ART) and closely associated with ART duration, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cell counts and the CD4/CD8 ratio. TCR-based age modeling showed a continuous accelerated trajectory of aging in PLWH, especially in younger individuals, in stark contrast to the nonlinear aging acceleration pattern seen in HC. Furthermore, using single-cell RNA combined TCR sequencing and in vitro experiments, we identified GNLY+CD8+ T cells as the primary population driving clonal expansion and maintenance in PLWH. These cells are characterized by high cytotoxicity and low exhaustion and are activated by interleukin-15 (IL-15) in vitro. Notably, GNLY+CD8+ T cells predominantly express the pro-inflammatory 15 kDa form of granulysin(GNLY). The supernatant from IL-15-stimulated CD8+ T cells induces monocytes to secrete inflammatory factors and disrupts the integrity of intestinal epithelial cells, which can be partially restored by the anti-GNLY antibodies. These findings identify GNLY+CD8+ T cells as the central drivers of persistent clonal expansion, highlighting their crucial role for mitigating inflammaging in PLWH.\n",

            "The United Kingdom, along with many other countries, is working towards eliminating viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030, with a combined mortality target of less than or equal to six deaths per 100,000 population. The current methodology of reporting uses death registrations alone, which has been estimated to underestimate mortality rates by up to 60% for hepatitis C (HCV)-related liver disease. We aim to conduct a sensitivity analysis using data linkage of death certificates, hepatitis B (HBV) and HCV diagnoses and admissions for end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and/or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to estimate mortality rates, assess progress towards elimination and evaluate underreporting. Between 2000 and 2023, 7967 deaths were reported due to HBV- and/or HCV-associated ESLD and/or HCC. Using data linkage of all three datasets, this increased to 11,487, with underreporting estimated to be 37% overall. The upper bound combined mortality rate was estimated to be 1.3 deaths per 100,000 population at its peak in 2015, therefore surpassing the WHO target for all years evaluated. From 2015 to 2023, both HCV-associated ESLD and/or HCC mortality decreased (1.12 to 0.88 deaths per 100,000 population), however, there was a slight increase for HBV-associated ESLD and/or HCC deaths during the same time frame (0.3 to 0.35). A higher proportion of HBV-related deaths were in males (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) who died outside London (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) and a lower proportion were White (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) when compared to HCV-related deaths. While England has met the WHO impact targets, it is important we continue to drive reductions in mortality.\n",

            "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) gD interaction with the host cell receptor nectin-1 triggers the membrane fusion cascade during viral entry. Potent neutralizing antibodies to gD prevent receptor-binding or prevent gD interaction with gH/gL critical for fusion. HSV has many strategies to evade host immune responses. We investigated the ability of virion envelope gC to protect envelope gD from antibody neutralization. HSV-1 lacking gC was more sensitive to neutralization by anti-gD monoclonal antibodies than a wild-type rescuant virus. gD in the HSV-1 gC-null viral envelope had enhanced reactivity to anti-gD antibodies compared to wild type. Soluble nectin-1 bound similar to HSV-1 particles regardless of the presence of gC in the envelope. However, entry of HSV-1 &#x394;gC was more sensitive to inhibition by soluble nectin-1 receptor. The viral membrane protein composition of HSV-1 &#x394;gC is equivalent to that of wild type, suggesting that the lack of gC is responsible for the increased reactivity of gD-specific antibodies and the consequent increased susceptibility to neutralization by those antibodies. Together, the results suggest that gC in the HSV-1 envelope shields both receptor-binding domains and gH/gL-interacting domains of gD from neutralizing antibodies, facilitating HSV cell entry.IMPORTANCEHSV-1 causes lifelong infections. There is no vaccine and no cure. Understanding HSV immune evasion strategies is an important goal. HSV-1 gC is a multi-functional envelope glycoprotein. This study suggests that virion gC physically shields neighboring gD from antibodies, including neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. This mechanism may allow HSV to escape immune detection, promoting HSV infection in the host.\n",

            "The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) is a protein machine mediating membrane scission. In intraluminal vesicle (ILV) formation, ESCRT-0 targets cargoes and recruits ESCRT-I/-II to create membrane invagination, whereas ESCRT-III coordinates with the AAA ATPase Vps4 and its cofactor Vta1 to catalyze the membrane fission. Recently, ESCRT-I/-III and Vps4 were found to be involved in the entry of the baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV). However, the necessity of other ESCRT components and the interplay of viral proteins and ESCRTs in regulating the virus entry remain elusive. Here, we identified ESCRT-0 (Hse1 and Vps27), ESCRT-II (Vps22, Vps25, and Vps36), and Vta1 of <i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i>. RNAi depletion of Vta1 but not the components of ESCRT-0 or ESCRT-II in Sf9 cells significantly reduced budded virus (BV) production. Quantitative PCR together with confocal microscopy analyses indicated that Vta1 was required for internalization and endosomal trafficking of BV. In the late phase of infection, although Vps4 and Vta1 were both distributed to the nucleus and at the plasma membrane, depletion of Vta1 did not affect BV release. Further analysis revealed that 7 of 14 BV envelope proteins (Ac75, Ac93, E25, F-like, P33, P48, and vUbiquitin) interacted with Vps4 and Vta1. Intriguingly, Ac93 adopted a similar mode as ESCRT-III proteins to interact with the microtubule-interacting and transport (MIT) domains of Vps4 and Vta1 via its C-terminal MIT-interacting motifs (MIM1), and the interactions were necessary for BV internalization. Together, our studies highlight the coordination of Vps4-Vta1 and Ac93, and probably other BV envelope proteins, in facilitating entry of AcMNPV.IMPORTANCEThe endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) system is involved in the entry of diverse DNA and RNA viruses. However, the interplay of viral proteins and ESCRTs in promoting virus endocytosis remains largely unknown. Here, we found that the ESCRT early acting factors ESCRT-0/-II were not necessary for infectious budded virus (BV) production of Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV). In contrast, the Vps4 cofactor Vta1 was required for entry but not egress of BV. Several core or essential BV envelope proteins were identified to interact with Vps4 and Vta1. Among them, Ac93 plays a central role in connecting other viral proteins and mimics ESCRT-III proteins to interact with Vps4-Vta1, facilitating entry of BV virions. These studies provide evidence for the coordination of viral proteins and ESCRTs in regulating entry of large enveloped DNA viruses.\n",

            "African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the pathogen of African swine fever (ASF), and its infection causes a lethal disease in pigs, with severe pathological lesions. These changes indicate excessive inflammatory responses in infected pigs, which is the main cause of death, but the ASFV proteins worked in this physiological process and the mechanisms underlying ASFV-induced inflammation remain unclear. Here, we identify that viral I177L works in these inflammatory responses. Mechanistically, I177L facilitates TRAF6 ubiquitination that enhances its binding to TAK1, which promotes TAK1 ubiquitination and phosphorylation. These processes depend on the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF6. The upregulation of I177L to TRAF6-TAK1 interaction and TAK1 activation is responsible for I177L's activated effect on the NF-&#x3ba;B signaling pathway. Additionally, I177L promotes assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome and ASC oligomerization, thus leading to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the production and secretion of mature IL-1&#x3b2;. TAK1 inhibition efficiently reverses ASFV-activated NF-&#x3ba;B signaling and inflammatory responses and suppresses ASFV replication. Furthermore, I177L-deficient ASFV induces milder inflammatory responses in pigs compared with parental ASFV, which still protects pigs against ASFV challenge. The finding confirms ASFV I177L as an important proinflammatory protein <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> and reveals a key mechanism underlying ASFV-mediated inflammatory responses for the first time, which enriches our knowledge of the complex ASFV, thus benefiting our understanding of the interplay between ASFV infection and the host's inflammatory responses.IMPORTANCEAfrican swine fever (ASF) is a devastating viral disease in pigs, and excessive inflammatory responses induced by ASFV mainly cause death. Thus, the study of the proinflammatory virulent proteins and the detailed mechanisms are important to ASF control. Here, I177L was demonstrated to be an essential protein in ASFV-mediated inflammation, which performs by simultaneously activating the NF-&#x3ba;B signaling and the NLRP3 inflammasome. The finding elucidates the molecular mechanism underlying ASFV-activated inflammatory responses for the first time. It provides a theoretical foundation for reducing the high mortality caused by excessive inflammation and opens new avenues for small-molecule drug development and vaccine design targeting ASFV.\n",

            "In the life cycle of a virus, host cell entry represents the first step that a virus needs to undertake to gain access to the cell interior for replication. Once a virus attaches itself to its target cell receptor, it activates endogenous cellular responses and exploits host cell factors for its internalization, fusion, and genome release. Among the host factors that critically contribute to the viral entry processes are cathepsins, which are the most abundant endo/lysosomal proteases with diverse physiological functions. This review summarizes previous findings on how different cathepsins contribute to the host cell entry of human pathogenic viruses, focusing on their specific roles in the entry processes of both enveloped and non-enveloped RNA viruses. A comprehensive knowledge of the functions of different cathepsins in viral entry will provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying viral infections and can be useful in the development of new antiviral strategies.\n",

            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to evolve, producing new variants that drive global coronavirus disease 2019 surges. XEC, a recombinant of KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, contains T22N and F59S mutations in the spike protein's N-terminal domain (NTD). The T22N mutation, similar to the DelS31 mutation in KP.3.1.1, introduces a potential N-linked glycosylation site in XEC. In this study, we examined the neutralizing antibody (nAb) response and mutation effects in sera from bivalent-vaccinated healthcare workers, BA.2.86/JN.1 wave-infected patients, and XBB.1.5 monovalent-vaccinated hamsters, assessing responses to XEC alongside D614G, JN.1, KP.3, and KP.3.1.1. XEC demonstrated significantly reduced neutralization titers across all cohorts, largely due to the F59S mutation. Notably, removal of glycosylation sites in XEC and KP.3.1.1 substantially restored nAb titers. Antigenic cartography analysis revealed XEC to be more antigenically distinct from its common ancestral BA.2.86/JN.1 compared to KP.3.1.1, with the F59S mutation as a determining factor. Similar to KP.3.1.1, XEC showed reduced cell-cell fusion relative to its parental KP.3, a change attributed to the T22N glycosylation. We also observed reduced S1 shedding for XEC and KP.3.1.1, which was reversed by ablation of T22N and DelS31 glycosylation mutations, respectively. Molecular modeling suggests that T22N and F59S mutations of XEC alter hydrophobic interactions with adjacent spike protein residues, impacting both conformational stability and neutralization. Overall, our findings underscore the pivotal role of NTD mutations in shaping SARS-CoV-2 spike biology and immune escape mechanisms.IMPORTANCEThe continuous evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to the emergence of novel variants with enhanced immune evasion properties, posing challenges for current vaccination strategies. This study identifies key N-terminal domain (NTD) mutations, particularly T22N and F59S in the recent XEC variant, which significantly impacts antigenicity, neutralization, and spike protein stability. The introduction of an N-linked glycosylation site through T22N, along with the antigenic shift driven by F59S, highlights how subtle mutations can drastically alter viral immune recognition. By demonstrating that glycosylation site removal restores neutralization sensitivity, this work provides crucial insights into the molecular mechanisms governing antibody escape. Additionally, the observed effects on spike protein shedding and cell-cell fusion contribute to a broader understanding of variant fitness and transmissibility. These findings emphasize the importance of monitoring NTD mutations in emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages and support the need for adaptive vaccine designs to counteract ongoing viral evolution.\n",

Current treatments, such as nucleos(t)ide analogs and interferon-&#x3b1;, effectively suppress viral replication but rarely cure the infection. To address this, new antivirals targeting different components of the HBV molecular machinery are being developed. Here we investigated the hepatitis B core protein (HBc) that forms the viral capsids and plays a vital role in the HBV life cycle. We explored two distinct binding pockets on the HBV capsid: the central hydrophobic pocket of HBc-dimers and the pocket at the tips of capsid spikes. We synthesized a geranyl dimer that binds to the central pocket with micromolar affinity, and dimeric peptides that bind the spike-tip pocket with sub-micromolar affinity. Cryo-electron microscopy further confirmed the binding of peptide dimers to the capsid spike tips and their capsid-aggregating properties. Finally, we show that the peptide dimers induce HBc aggregation in vitro and in living cells. Our findings highlight two tractable sites within the HBV capsid and provide an alternative strategy to affect HBV capsids.\n",

This study examines the factors influencing mental health, stress perception, and burnout among otolaryngology nurses after the cessation of COVID-19 prevention and control. <b>Methods</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted among 220 otolaryngology nurses in Sichuan province from 20 January to 28 January, 2023. Data were collected using a general information questionnaire, the Nurse Workplace Mental Health Questionnaire, the Chinese Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS-14), and the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS). Statistical analyses included the Kruskal-Wallis test, Spearman correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression to identify significant factors and relationships within the dataset. <b>Results</b> Of the 220 questionnaires distributed, 218 were valid, yielding a recovery rate of 99.09%. The cohort included 3 males (mean age: 34.67 &#xb1; 12.39) and 215 females (mean age: 35.63 &#xb1; 9.27). The average mental health score was 128.10 &#xb1; 21.29, indicating a moderate level of psychological well-being. The CPSS-14 average score was 37.42 &#xb1; 7.27, reflecting moderate stress, while MBI-GS scores highlighted varying levels of burnout, especially in emotional exhaustion (median = 10.00). The Kruskal-Wallis test identified significant factors affecting mental health, stress, and burnout, including family support, COVID-19 testing status, staffing adequacy, frequency of caring for critically ill patients, teamwork satisfaction, job satisfaction, and resignation plans (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Spearman correlation analysis revealed significant negative associations between mental health and stress (r = -0.525) and total burnout scores (r = -0.646; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Multiple linear regression identified emotional exhaustion (&#x3b2; = -0.922), low personal accomplishment (&#x3b2; = -0.623), and inadequate staffing (&#x3b2; = -2.769) as significant negative predictors of mental health, while teamwork satisfaction (&#x3b2; = 5.516) and job satisfaction (&#x3b2; = 5.032) were positively associated with improved mental health (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). <b>Conclusion</b> Otolaryngology nurses experience notable mental health challenges in the post-pandemic era, driven by stress and burnout. Addressing staffing shortages, fostering teamwork, and enhancing job satisfaction are critical strategies to improve their psychological well-being.\n",

            "Arboviral diseases are viral infections transmitted to humans through the bites of arthropods, such as mosquitoes, often causing a variety of pathologies associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality. Over the past decades, these infections have proven to be a significant challenge to health systems worldwide, particularly following the considerable geographic expansion of the dengue virus (DENV) and its most recent outbreak in Latin America as well as the difficult-to-control outbreaks of yellow fever virus (YFV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Zika virus (ZIKV), leaving behind a substantial portion of the population with complications related to these infections. Currently, the world is experiencing a period of intense globalization, which, combined with global warming, directly contributes to wider dissemination of arbovirus vectors across the globe. Consequently, all continents remain on high alert for potential new outbreaks. Thus, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of the four main arboviruses today (DENV, ZIKV, YFV, and CHIKV) discussing their viral characteristics, immune responses, and mechanisms of viral evasion, as well as important clinical aspects for patient management. This includes associated symptoms, laboratory tests, treatments, existing or developing vaccines and the main associated complications, thus integrating a broad historical, scientific and clinical approach.\n",

With a case fatality rate between 10% to 40%, the most common ways that the disease may spread to humans are <i>via</i> tick bites or coming into touch with infected animals' blood or tissues. Furthermore, the transfer of bodily fluids between individuals is another potential route of infection. There is a wide range of symptoms experienced by patients throughout each stage, from myalgia and fever to extreme bruising and excess bleeding. Tick management measures include minimising the spread of ticks from one species to another and from people to animals <i>via</i> the use of protective clothing, repellents, and proper animal handling. In order to prevent the spread of illness, healthcare workers must adhere to stringent protocols. Despite the lack of an authorised vaccine, the main components of treatment now consist of preventative measures and supportive care, which may include the antiviral medicine ribavirin. We still don't know very much about the virus's mechanisms, even though advances in molecular virology and animal models have improved our understanding of the pathogenesis of CCHFV. A critical need for vaccination that is both safe and effective, as well as for quick diagnosis and efficient treatments to lessen the disease's impact in areas where it is most prevalent.

However, a common health consequence of enteric virus infections is gastrointestinal diseases following a shift in gut microbial composition. The sub-Saharan hipposiderid bat complex has recently emerged to host at least three coronaviruses (CoVs), with <i>Hipposideros caffer D</i> appearing particularly susceptible to <i>Hibecovirus</i> CoV-2B infection. In this study, we complement body condition and infection status data with information about the gut microbial community to understand the health impact of CoV infections in a wild bat population. Of the three CoVs, only infections with the distantly SARS-related <i>Hibecovirus</i> CoV-2B were associated with lower body condition and altered the gut microbial diversity and composition. The gut microbial community of infected bats became progressively less diverse and more dissimilar with infection intensity, arguing for dysbiosis as per the Anna Karenina principle. Putatively beneficial bacteria, such as <i>Alistipes</i> and <i>Christensenella</i>, decreased with infection intensity, while potentially pathogenic bacteria, namely <i>Mycoplasma</i> and <i>Staphylococcus</i>, increased. Infections with enterically replicating viruses may therefore cause changes in body condition and gut dysbiosis with potential negative health consequences even in virus reservoirs. We argue that high-resolution data on multiple health markers, ideally including microbiome information, will provide a more nuanced picture of bat disease ecology.\n",

            "The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM), significantly increasing their risk of adverse outcomes. This retrospective study aimed to explore the underlying factors contributing to the heightened vulnerability of individuals with DM to severe COVID-19. We reviewed medical records of patients diagnosed with DM from August 2020 to August 2022 and identified 60 equally divided into two groups. Group A (<i>n</i> = 30) included those diagnosed with an associated COVID-19 infection, while Group B (<i>n</i> = 30) served as the control group without a COVID-19 infection. Inflammatory biomarkers, venous blood glucose levels, and other parameters were assessed at hospital admission and again after a 14-day treatment period. Statistical analysis confirmed a strong association between diabetes and COVID-19 infection. In COVID-19 patients treated with Empagliflozin, correlations were observed between IL-1, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and blood glucose levels. Patients in Group B did not show significant improvements in inflammatory markers or blood glucose control. In contrast, in the first group, better correlations between interleukin levels and blood glucose were demonstrated, suggesting a higher success rate for that treatment. Our findings indicate that while Empagliflozin had limited efficacy in managing long-term diabetes-related complications, it might offer significant benefits in the acute phase of illness.\n",

            "Using county-level data from the United States, we assessed allometric scaling relationships of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases, deaths and age structure within and across the first four major waves of the pandemic (wild-type, alpha, delta, omicron). Results generally indicate that the burden of cases disproportionately impacted larger-sized counties, while the burden of deaths disproportionately impacted smaller counties. This may be partially due to multiple interacting social mechanisms, including a higher proportion of older adults who live in smaller counties. Moreover, these likely social mechanisms interacting with vaccinations and virus waves created a dynamic pattern whereby the rate and magnitude of infections and deaths were population- and time-dependent. Our results offer a novel perspective on the scaling dynamics of infectious diseases, highlighting how both the rate and magnitude of COVID-19 cases and deaths scale differently across counties. Population size and age structure are key factors in predicting disease burden. Our findings have practical implications, suggesting that scaling-informed public health policies could more effectively allocate resources and interventions to mitigate the impact of future epidemics across heterogeneous populations.\n",

The analysis reveals a significant association, with a calculated risk ratio of 2.97 (95% CI, 1.70-5.19, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0001), indicating that individuals diagnosed with primary MCC are nearly three times more likely to develop the second skin cancer compared to patients with other second cancers. Among the second skin cancers analysed, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) showed the highest risk (0.69, 95% CI 0.35-1.37), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (0.45, 95% CI 0.23-0.90) and melanoma (0.31, 95% CI 0.19-0.50). While geographic analysis showed that patients in Northern Europe have a non-significant 1.7-fold increased likelihood of developing the second skin cancer relative to those in North America (USA), where the likelihood of developing the second skin cancer is significantly lower at 0.7 times. The results underscore the importance of implementing enhanced surveillance and preventive strategies for individuals at increased risk. By identifying these associations, we may improve the early detection of the second skin cancer in patients with MCC.\n",

            "<b>Objective:</b> To explore the therapeutic efficacy and prognostic factors of combined rituximab and intensive chemotherapy for sporadic adult Burkitt lymphoma (BL) . <b>Methods:</b> This retrospective study examined the clinical and survival data of 30 patients newly diagnosed with BL between July 2011 and February 2023 at the Blood Diseases Hospital. Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis, and the log-rank test was used for univariate analysis of prognostic factors. <b>Results:</b> The median age of the 30 patients was 43 years (24 - 66 years), and the male to female ratio was 3: 2. Extranodal invasion was present in 80% of the patients, with involvement of the bone marrow in 53.3% and central nervous system in 10.0%. The Ann Arbor stage was &#x2162; and &#x2163; in 86.7%. According to the number of Burkitt Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (BL-IPI) risk factors, patients were classified as low risk (0) in 20.0%, intermediate risk (1) in 43.3%, and high risk (&#x2265;2) in 36.7%. All patients were treated with an induction regimen of rituximab combined with intensive chemotherapy, with objective and complete response rates of 80.0% and 76.7%, respectively. The median follow-up was 49 months (6-153 months), and the 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were both (76.7&#xb1;7.7) %. All patients with limited stage (<i>n</i>=4) achieved continuous complete remission (CCR). Patients who had high risk, advanced stage sensitive to induction therapy (<i>n</i>=10) sequentially received first-line autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) as consolidation therapy; 9 patients achieved CCR, whereas 1 patient with central nervous system invasion developed early disease progression and died. The BL-IPI low, intermediate, and high risk groups had respective 5-year PFS rates of (83.3&#xb1;15.2) %, 100.0%, and (45.5&#xb1;15.0) % (<i>P</i>=0.0069) and OS rates of (83.3&#xb1;15.2) %, 100.0%, and (45.5&#xb1;15.0) % (<i>P</i>=0.0075). The main adverse effects of induction therapy were myelosuppression and secondary infections, which were effectively managed by appropriate symptomatic treatment. Univariate analysis demonstrated that worse PFS was associated with BL-IPI score &#x2265;2 (<i>HR</i>=4.90, 95% <i>CI</i> 1.02-23.45, <i>P</i>=0.0329) ; extranodal invasion at &#x2265;2 sites (<i>HR</i>=12.62, 95% <i>CI</i> 2.59-61.62, <i>P</i>=0.0021) ; and failure to achieve first complete response (CR1) after induction therapy (<i>HR</i>=31.86, 95% <i>CI</i> 4.19-242.20, <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001) . <b>Conclusions:</b> Intensive immunochemotherapy regimens were effective and well-tolerated by adult patients with highly aggressive BL. Treatment efficacy was ideal in patients with limited-stage disease, whereas prognosis was unsatisfactory in patients with high-risk BL-IPI. Sequential first-line auto-HSCT consolidation therapy may further improve outcomes in patients with high-risk advanced-stage disease who are sensitive to induction therapy. BL-IPI score &#x2265;2, extranodal invasion at &#x2265;2 sites, and failure to achieve CR1 after induction therapy were adverse prognostic factors in adult patients with BL.\n",

            "The overall incidence of lymphomas associated with HIV infection is low, and only few hematological oncology specialties provide standardized treatment. Newly diagnosed patients with impaired immune function have a high incidence of complications, such as infections during induction chemotherapy, which increases treatment difficulties. For patients with relapse/refractory status, salvage treatment options are extremely limited, because new drug clinical trials are lacking. At present, both domestic and international clinical practices have shown that patients with lymphomas associated with HIV infection can achieve long-term survival after standardized combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with targeted immunochemotherapy, followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) immediately after achieving complete remission. In recent years, some new drugs, such as XPO1 inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, antibody-drug conjugates (ADC drugs), bispecific antibodies, and small-molecule drugs, have been tentatively incorporated into treatment regimens for patients with lymphomas associated with HIV infection, and preliminary clinical data have been obtained. Based on two patients with lymphomas associated with HIV infection who were admitted to our center, this study proposed a standardized diagnostic and treatment pathway and provided corresponding references for clinicians to apply new drugs. The aim of this study was to promote diagnostic and treatment capabilities and improve the survival and quality of life of patients of lymphomas associated with HIV infection in China.\n",

Most trials focused on viral infections and were single-country studies. Pharmaceutical company sponsors funded most of the earlier trials, with increased government and academic involvement post-2020. Despite progress, challenges remain in the geographic distribution of trials, the number of government-supported studies, and the diversity of conditions studied.

But older adults may reside in long-term care settings not served by the community pharmacies associated with immunization gains. This descriptive summary of the Advancing Pharmacist Immunization Initiative (APII) presents an overview of our efforts to advance pharmacist-led immunization among older adults, including those in long-term care sites in communities with health disparities, through pharmacist education and outreach activities. <b>Setting</b> Communities with high and very high Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and COVID-19 Vaccine Coverage Index (CVAC) scores, including those in longterm care, in a pilot region in the United States. <b>Methods</b> Through pharmacist education and community outreach, the APII seeks to advance pharmacist-led immunization practices. Guided by our Subject Matter Experts and Technical Expert Panel, we seek to improve pharmacist vaccine administration and advocacy nationally and improve trust and confidence in vaccines in the community. Our initial steps have focused on identifying a pilot region to test our strategies, as we prepare to scale up in subsequent years. The Institutional Review Board of the American Institutes for Research has determined that the research reported in this paper is exempt, IRB00000436 / FWA00003952. <b>Results</b> Based on an environmental scan, the San Antonio, Texas region was chosen as the APII pilot region; it met the criteria of high or very high SVI (0.83-very high) and CVAC (0.87-very high), 12.1% of the population is at least 65 years of age, with older adult vaccination rates below the 2021 national average for pneumococcal disease and influenza. We launched a national pharmacist education program, which showed increases in pharmacist knowledge and confidence in immunization. <b>Conclusion</b> Immunization reduces preventable morbidity and mortality, but it is underused. Pharmacist education could help meet access or information needs, especially since disparities in immunization and health outcomes vary geographically. By identifying communities of older adults in need of pharmacist-led immunization, and offering outreach, our program may help advance immunization.\n",

            "Orthohantaviruses are emerging zoonotic pathogens that cause severe human disease and are considered an emerging public health threat globally. Mammalian orthohantaviruses are naturally maintained in rodent species and occasionally in other mammals. The abundance and density of natural orthohantavirus reservoir species are affected by multi&#xa0;annual and seasonal population cycles, community composition, ecosystem variables and climate. Horizontal transmission between host species is mostly density-driven and occurs via contact with infected host excreta, thus, fluctuations in populations and environmental variables often determine the prevalence of hantavirus in natural hosts. Given the zoonotic potential of hantaviruses, ecological factors influencing their spread and persistence in their natural reservoir and population dynamics influencing horizontal transmission require critical evaluation for human infection&#xa0;risk assessment. The present review paper discusses the impacts of natural host population cycles and ecosystem diversity, environmental conditions, and abiotic factors on the epidemiology of rodent-borne hantavirus infections in Europe. While significant efforts have been made to understand the drivers of hantavirus prevalence in natural hosts, we highlight key challenges in evaluating viral prevalence and assessing the role of environmental and population variables in determining hantavirus prevalence in host species.\n",

            "Rat hepatitis E virus (ratHEV-C1) is a newly zoonotic and globally distributed virus of increasing public health concern. Although rats of the genus Rattus are the main reservoir of this emerging virus, the role of other small mammals in the epidemiology of ratHEV-C1 in Europe is unknown as large-scale survey studies specifically assessing the circulation of ratHEV-C1 in these species have not yet been conducted. In this study, we examined active ratHEV-C1 infection in 514 animals from seven different small mammal species sampled throughout Spain. The presence of viral RNA was evaluated for ratHEV-C1 infection using RT-qPCRs in liver tissue. Sequencing and analysis of ratHEV-C1 shedding in faeces were carried out in positive animals. Viral RNA was detected in 15 individuals (mean Ct value: 34.5), supposing a frequency of 2.9% (95% CI: 1.8-4.8). We confirmed ratHEV infection in house mice (14.5%; 11/76), common voles (0.7%; 2/288) and garden dormice (25.0%; 2/8) and viral shedding in faeces in 36.4% (4/11) of positive house mice. Infected animals were detected in urban areas, small ruminant farms and rural areas throughout Spain. Our sequences showed a considerable genetic diversity, and they were closely related with ratHEV-C1 strains detected in human and rats from Spain, Germany and Hungary. Our study confirms that ratHEV is not limited to Rattus genus, identifying other rodents' species as potential host of ratHEV-C1 in Europe. Our results highlight the importance of continued surveillance in animals to fully understand the dynamics of ratHEV-C1 and its impact on public health.\n",

            "Bats are reservoirs for numerous viruses that cause serious diseases in other animals and humans. Several mechanisms are proposed to contribute to the tolerance of bats to these pathogens. This study investigates the response of bat cells to double-stranded RNA generated by SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we found the involvement of Dicer in the processing of viral genomic RNAs during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Examining RNA sequencing of infected cells, small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-like fragments were found derived from viral RNAs. Depletion of Dicer showed a reduction in these RNAs and an increase in viral loads suggesting unlike other mammals, bats may use Dicer to limit viral replication. This prompted the exploration of key dsRNA sensors in bat cells. Our analysis showed significant upregulation of OAS1 and MX1 in response to dsRNA, while PKR levels remained low, suggesting alternative dsRNA-response mechanisms are present that eschew the common PKR-based system. These results further show how bats employ distinct strategies for antiviral defense that may contribute to tolerating viral infections. They suggest the involvement of Dicer in antiviral mechanisms in bats, a function not observed in other mammals. This highlights a mechanism for bat originating viruses to evolve features that in other animals could cause extreme antiviral responses such as is seen with SARS-CoV-2.\n",

            "Since SARS-CoV-2 has caused unprecedented changes in the epidemiology of other infectious diseases, investigations on coinfection between SARS-CoV-2 and one of the famous vector-borne diseases, malaria, are crucial for disease control, especially in malaria-endemic areas. The clinical profiles, possible mechanisms for interactions, and representative control measures of COVID-19 and malaria coinfections have recently garnered public attention. The overlap in epidemiology, infection incubation, and clinical symptoms between COVID-19 and malaria coinfections has been thoroughly discussed to provide a detailed diagnostic procedure for coinfections, thereby guiding appropriate clinical interventions. Immunological and genetic evidence has shown that previous malaria exposure may protect the body from the poor prognosis of COVID-19. ACE2 downregulation and TLR-induced pathways play a role in this protective effect, as do CD8&#x2009;+&#x2009;and CD4&#x2009;+&#x2009;T-cell activation and coinhibitory receptor upregulation, which help maintain a balance of immune reactions. Finally, multiple control measures for coinfections were discussed, and malaria control efforts were enriched in the context of COVID-19. These efforts included (1) developing vaccinations; (2) evaluating the efficacy of anti-malarial drugs in the SARS-CoV-2 treatment; (3) exploring recent advances in natural products that are potentially useful for coinfection treatment; (4) researching and implementing bioinsecticides for malaria control, such as gene-driven mosquitoes, fungi, and bacterial symbionts; and (5) improving national electronic disease surveillance platforms in malaria-endemic regions. At last, the above findings summarized valuable lessons about malaria and COVID-19 control and expedite further investigations on coinfections with complex clinical presentations.\n",

            "The impact of different weaning strategies on the downstream circulation of PRRSV has not been widely described. It is, however, believed that mixing pigs of different age groups is increasing the risk of PRRSV circulation in the nursery section. In this study, pigs were sampled in three herds that performed \"mixed at weaning (MIX)\" and three herds that performed \"all in/all out at weaning (AIAO)\". MIX included holding underweighted piglets back in containers for two weeks and then move them to nursery facilities with newly weaned piglets from subsequent batches. Oral fluid samples were collected from four batches of pigs in each herd, three times from weaning until 30&#xa0;kg for each batch, and tested for PRRSV and PRRSV antibodies. Herds that performed MIX at weaning had an eightfold increase in risk of detecting PRRSV in oral fluids compared to herds with AIAO. In total, 41 oral fluid samples from eight batches in MIX herds and five oral fluid samples from two batches in AIAO herds tested positive for PRRSV. The PRRSV ELISA S/P ratio in oral fluid samples from weaners seem to decrease in most of the batches in the AIAO herds and to increase in most MIX herds. In addition to oral fluids, tongue tip samples were collected from dead pigs and tested for PRRSV. In 17 of 23 batches the results of the tongue tip samples correlated with the results of the oral fluid samples (&#x3ba;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.44) indicating a good agreement between the two materials for sampling. Overall, the results of the study confirmed that the weaning strategy had a significant impact on the circulation of PRRSV post weaning.\n",

            "The daily surge in cases in many nations has made the growing number of human monkeypox (Mpox) cases an important global concern. Therefore, it is imperative to identify Mpox early to prevent its spread. The majority of studies on Mpox identification have utilized deep learning (DL) models. However, research on developing a reliable method for accurately detecting Mpox in its early stages is still lacking. This study proposes an ensemble model composed of three improved DL models to more accurately classify Mpox in its early phases. We used the widely recognized Mpox Skin Images Dataset (MSID), which includes 770 images. The enhanced Swin Transformer (SwinViT), the proposed ensemble model Mpox-XDE, and three modified DL models-Xception, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB7-were used. To generate the ensemble model, the three DL models were combined via a Softmax layer, a dense layer, a flattened layer, and a 65% dropout. Four neurons in the final layer classify the dataset into four categories: chickenpox, measles, normal, and Mpox. Lastly, a global average pooling layer is implemented to classify the actual class. The Mpox-XDE model performed exceptionally well, achieving testing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 98.70%, 98.90%, 98.80%, and 98.80%, respectively. Finally, the popular explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), was applied to the convolutional layer of the Mpox-XDE model to generate overlaid areas that effectively highlight each illness class in the dataset. This proposed methodology will aid professionals in diagnosing Mpox early in a patient's condition.\n",

            "Timely and accurate detection of the virus is of great significance to prevent the virus's harm and control the epidemic. Here, an aptasensor based on the principle of promoting hybridization through aptamer conformational change was designed to quantitatively detect the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. When the S protein binds to the 3' end of the aptamer, the 5' end of the aptamer tansforms into a straight hybridization region, which will greatly facilitate the hybridization with complementary DNA (cDNA). In the absence of S protein, hybridization is less likely to occur due to the complex G-quadruplex structure of aptamer. According to this principle, cDNA is modified onto magnetic beads (MBs) or onto the optical fiber probe of an evanescent wave fluorescence aptasensor (EWFA) detection platform to capture the fluorescently labeled aptamer-S protein conjugate, two kinds of quantitative detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 S protein were established. In particular, simple, rapid and sensitive detection could be obtained based on the EWFA detection platform, in which the whole detection procedure including the measurement and regeneration takes&#xa0; only 14&#xa0;min, the LOD is 5.34&#xa0;ng/mL, the linear response range is 141.49 to 9507.36&#xa0;ng/mL, and the optical fiber probe could be reused for 19 times. The EWFA detection platform is also potentially applicable to detect other protein biomarkers only by replacing the specifically modified optical fiber probes.\n",

Many prognostic statistical tools have been developed for the prediction of disease severity, but it is still unclear which ones should be used in practice. We aim to guide clinicians in choosing the best available tools to make optimal decisions and assess their role in resource management and assess what can be learned from the COVID-19 scenario for development of prediction models in similar medical applications. Using the five major medical databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and Scopus, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review of prediction tools between 2020 January and 2023 April for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We identified both the relevant confounding factors of tool performance using the MetaForest algorithm and the best tools-comparing linear, machine learning, and deep learning methods-with mixed-effects meta-regression models. The risk of bias was evaluated using the PROBAST tool. Our systematic search identified eligible 27,312 studies, out of which 290 were eligible for data extraction, reporting on 430 independent evaluations of severity prediction tools with ~&#x2009;2.8&#xa0;million patients. Neural Network-based tools have the highest performance with a pooled AUC of 0.893 (0.748-1.000), 0.752 (0.614-0.853) sensitivity, 0.914 (0.849-0.952) specificity, using clinical, laboratory, and imaging data. The relevant confounders of performance are the geographic region of patients, the rate of severe cases, and the use of C-Reactive Protein as input data. 88% of studies have a high risk of bias, mostly because of deficiencies in the data analysis. All investigated tools in use aid decision-making for COVID-19 severity prediction, but Machine Learning tools, specifically Neural Networks clearly outperform other methods, especially in cases when the basic characteristics of severe and non-severe patient groups are similar, and without the need for more data. When highly specific biomarkers are not available-such as in the case of COVID-19-practitioners should abandon general clinical severity scores and turn to disease specific Machine Learning tools.\n",

            "Hypertension is one of the most common risk factors for COVID-19 clinical progression. The identification of plasma biomarkers for anticipating worse clinical outcomes and to better understand the shared mechanisms between hypertension and COVID-19 are needed. A hypothesis-generating study was designed to compare plasma proteomics and metabolomics between 22 hypertensives (HT) and 41 non-hypertensives (nHT) patients with the most unfavorable COVID-19 progression. A total of 43 molecules were significantly differed between HT (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;22) and nHT (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;41). Random Forest (RF) analysis identified myo-inositol, gelsolin and phosphatidylcholine (PC) 32:1 as the top molecules for distinguishing between HT and nHT. Plasma myo-inositol and gelsolin were higher (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03 and P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.02, respectively) and plasma PC 32:1 was lower (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03) in HT compared to nHT. Biological processes like stress response and blood coagulation, along with KEGG pathways including ascorbate and aldarate metabolism (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.021) and linoleic acid metabolism (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.028), were altered in hypertensive patients with the most unfavorable COVID-19 progression. There is a clear link between hypertension and severe COVID-19. Key biological pathways to consider for improving the prognosis and quality of life of hypertensive patients who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 include oxidative stress, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, lipid metabolism, immune system and inflammation.\n",

            "Highly pathogenic H5Nx avian influenza viruses are endemic in animals in many countries. These viruses cause the severe diseases in chickens, but they cause much milder diseases in ducks. The vaccination is one of the tools to prevent the infections of ducks by highly pathogenic H5Nx avian influenza viruses. Here, we studied the efficacy of oil-adjuvanted H5 cleavage peptide vaccine in ducks. The vaccinated ducks challenged with H5N6 and H5N8 avian influenza viruses were protected without viral detection in the tracheal and cloacal swabs. The protective immunity in the immunized ducks lasted until 16&#xa0;weeks post-vaccination. Our results suggest that H5 cleavage site peptide vaccine can be one of the candidate vaccines to provide the protective immunity to ducks against H5Nx avian influenza viruses.Please confirm if the author names are presented accurately and in the correct sequence.

            "The evolution of COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by the rapid emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, each of which poses unique challenges to public health. This study analyzes the dispersion profiles during the Pre-Omicron and Post-Omicron phases in different epidemiological contexts. The Brazilian state of Espirito Santo, despite its low population density, plays a critical role as a commercial hub due to its intense port activity, which may have contributed to COVID-19 cases and mortality rates being higher than the national average. The state recorded 34,000 confirmed cases and 377 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. Genomic surveillance revealed that the Pre-Omicron phase was dominated by the B.1.1.33 lineage, characterized by localized intraregional circulation. In contrast, the Post-Omicron phase, dominated by the BQ.1.1 lineage, exhibited greater diversity in circulating lineages, increased international interactions, and rapid viral dissemination, highlighting distinct transmission dynamics between such periods. This study highlights the need for adaptive public health strategies that account for both viral behavior and regional socioeconomic factors, while highlighting the strategic importance of Espirito Santo in monitoring SARS-CoV-2 evolution.\n",

            "Syphilis is one of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The incidence of Treponema pallidum infection has increased in the last 20 years. This rise is also evident in ophthalmological practice, with cases of ocular syphilis becoming more frequent.We present a case of a 29-year-old patient with blurred vision in his left eye. Patient showed no general symptoms, nor previous history of eye disorders. On ophthalmological examination, the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20 in the right eye (OD) and 20/80 in the left eye (OS). The left eye presented high intraocular pressure (IOP) of 31 mmHg and symptoms of anterior uveitis with a linear branching corneal erosion. A B-scan ultrasound of the left eye revealed no vitritis. The preliminary diagnosis of herpetic infection was made, and antiviral therapy was introduced. Despite the initial improvement, symptoms of active anterior uveitis were found on follow-up visits. After approximately 4 weeks of ambulatory treatment, the patient was admitted to the hospital because of roseolae and lumps of the left iris, which appeared accompanied by a rash on patients' lower limbs. Laboratory tests confirmed syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection. During hospitalization intravenous treatment with penicillin and antiretroviral drugs was introduced. Therapy with penicillin was continued to 21 days with improvement in examination. On a follow-up visit after 6 months BCVA in both eyes was 20/20.It is crucial to consider testing for STIs, especially Treponema pallidum infection, in the diagnostic process of patients with nontypical or nonresponsive to treatment ocular symptoms.\n",

            "Coxsackievirus B1 (CVB1) is a common cause of acute and chronic myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, and meningitis. CVBs replicate in mucosal membranes. Therefore, vaccines inducing robust mucosal immune responses are needed. We investigated the immunogenicity of virus-like particles (VLP) and inactivated virus vaccines for CVB1, administered to mice either subcutaneously or intranasally, formulated with and without commercial and an experimental adjuvant. In this study, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) was used both as a potential adjuvant and as an inactivating agent. EGCG adjuvanted CVB1-VLP enhanced immunogenicity via the parenteral route, but not intranasally. EGCG-adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted CVB1-VLPs triggered an immune response after intranasal administration, although the response remained weak. Intranasal administration of formalin-inactivated virus elicited robust CVB1-specific humoral, cellular, and mucosal immune responses, but after EGCG-inactivation, the mucosal antibody response was lower than after formalin-inactivation. To identify the link between structure and mucosal immunogenicity, we solved the structures of CVB1-VLP and formalin-inactivated CVB1 virus at resolutions ranging from 2.15 to 4.1 &#xc5;. The structural difference between VLP and formalin-inactivated CVB1 was the presence of the genome and cross-linked amino acid residues in the formalin-inactivated virus. Formalin-inactivated CVB1 vaccine shows promise for mucosal immunizations and the structural data supports the development of next-generation VLP-vaccines in the future.\n",

            "COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can provide information on patient immunity, identify asymptomatic patients, and track the spread of COVID-19. Efforts have been made to develop methods to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in humans. Here, we describe a flow cytometric assay for the simultaneous detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM in human plasma. To assess the antibody response against the different SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, five viral recombinant proteins, including spike protein subunit 1 (S1), N-terminal domain of S1 (S1A), spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), spike protein subunit 2 (S2), and nucleocapsid protein (N), were generated. A comparison of the antibody profiles detected by the assay with plasma from 100 healthy blood donors collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and plasma from 100 virologically confirmed COVID-19 patients demonstrated a clear discrimination between the two groups. Among the COVID-19 patients, the antibody responses for the viral proteins, as determined by their prevalence, were anti-RBD IgG&#x2009;=&#x2009;anti-N IgG&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;anti-S1 IgG&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;anti-S1A IgG&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;anti-S2 IgG, and anti-RBD IgM&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;anti-S1 IgM&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;anti-N IgM&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;anti-S2 IgM. The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM was not associated with sex, age, race, days after the onset of symptoms, or severity of illness, except for a higher prevalence of anti-S2 IgG being observed in men than in women. The levels of anti-RBD IgG were higher in patients 65&#xa0;years and older and in patients who had severe symptoms. Similarly, patients who had severe symptoms exhibited higher levels of anti-S1 and anti-S1A IgG than patients who had mild or moderate symptoms. The levels of anti-RBD IgM tended to be higher in men but did not differ among age, race, days after the onset of symptoms, or severity of illness. Our study indicates that the flow cytometric assay, especially using RBD as target antigen, can be used to detect simultaneously anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies in human plasma.\n",

            "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant global health and economic disruption. Mutations E166N, E166R, E166N, S144A and His163A in the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) have been implicated in reducing the efficacy of certain antiviral treatments. Bofutrelvir, a promising inhibitor, has shown effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>. This study aims to evaluate the inhibitory effects of Bofutrelvir on the E166N, E166R, His163A, E166V and S144A mutants of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>, as well as on MERS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup>. Our findings indicate a substantial reduction in the inhibitory potency of Bofutrelvir against these mutants and MERS-CoV, with IC<sub>50</sub> values significantly higher than those for the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>. Specifically, the E166N, E166R, E166V, S144A, and H163A mutations significantly reduce the binding affinity and inhibitory effectiveness of Bofutrelvir due to disrupted hydrogen bonds, altered binding site stability, and reduced enzyme activity. Structural analysis of the crystal complexes showed that changes in interactions at the S1 subsite in the mutants and the loss of hydrogen bonds at the S4 subsite in MERS-CoV M<sup>pro</sup> are critical factors contributing to the diminished inhibitory activity. These insights reveal the necessity of ongoing structural analysis to adapt therapeutic strategies.\n",

            "An infection of SARS-CoV-1, the causative agent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), may be followed by long-term clinical sequala. We hypothesized a greater 20-year multimorbidity incidence in people hospitalized for SARS-CoV-1 infection than those for influenza during similar periods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a territory-wide public healthcare database in Hong Kong. All patients aged &#x2265;15 hospitalized for SARS in 2003 or influenza in 2002 or 2004 with no more than one of 30 listed chronic disease were included. Demographics, clinical history, and medication use were adjusted for in the inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighted Poisson regression analyses. We identified 1255 hospitalizations for SARS-CoV-1 infection and 687 hospitalizations for influenza. Overall crude multimorbidity incident rates were 1.5 per 100 person-years among SARS patients and 5.6 among influenza patients. Adjusted multimorbidity incidence rate ratio (IRR) was estimated at 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.70-0.86) for SARS patients compared with influenza patients. Analysis by follow-up period shows a potentially greater risk among SARS patients in the first year of follow-up (IRR 1.33, 95% CI 0.97-1.84), with the risk in influenza patients increasing in subsequent years. Subgroup analyses by age and sex showed consistent results with the main analysis that SARS-CoV-1 infection was not followed by a higher incidence of multimorbidity than influenza. Notable differences in the patterns of multimorbidity were identified between the two arms. To conclude, we found no evidence of a higher multimorbidity incidence after hospitalization for SARS than for influenza over the long-term.\n",

            "People who inject drugs (PWID) are at higher risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) due to their behaviors such as shared injection. Employing appropriate modeling approaches is crucial for accurately evaluating the impact of other variables on outcomes, in this case, HCV seropositivity. This study aimed to assess the non-linear effect of injection duration on HCV seropositivity. From July 2019 to March 2020, 2,684 PWID in Iran were recruited. The binary outcome variable was HCV serostatus (positive vs. negative), determined by detecting HCV antibodies. The non-linear effect of injection duration on HCV seropositivity was assessed using a multilevel Generalized Additive Model in R software, adjusting the effects of other variables in the analysis. We found a non-linear effect of injection duration on HCV seropositivity status (p-value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). The probability of HCV seropositivity increased with injection duration, though this relationship was non-linear. Initially, the probability rises faster; however, this effect diminishes as the injection duration extends. An initial sharp increase in HCV risk was seen during the first 20 years of injection. HCV seropositivity was notably associated with ever HIV seropositivity (OR [Odds Ratio]&#x2009;=&#x2009;10.54, 95% CI [Confidence Interval]: 5.39, 20.61, p-value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), ever having injected methamphetamine (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.72, 95% CI: 1.33, 2.22, p-value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), being currently married (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.67, 95% CI: 0.48, 0.93, p-value&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.018), ever shared needle/syringe with others (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.63, 95% CI: 1.32, 5.22, p-value&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006), and ever being incarcerated (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.97, 95% CI: 1.50, 2.58, p-value&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Our study contributes to the field by demonstrating that a non-linear approach can reveal patterns of risk that linear models might fail to capture. These findings indicate that the relationship between injection duration and HCV seropositivity can be more complex than previously understood, underscoring the importance of employing more advanced modeling techniques in future research.\n",

            "The severity of COVID-19 has varied across regions, with a disproportionately higher case-fatality ratio in developed nations. In India, states with higher income have reported more COVID-19 related deaths compared to lower-income states. Understanding the underlying factors such as demographics, disease burden, urbanization, and sanitation can help in designing better public health policies to mitigate future pandemics. The objective of this study is to identify key predictors of COVID-19 mortality across Indian states by examining the role of disease prevalence, demographics, urbanization, and sanitation. We analysed data from the Global Burden of Diseases India 2019 and the National Health Profile 2019, correlating them with COVID-19 mortality during two peak periods of the pandemic. Spearman correlation analysis and multivariate regression models were employed to determine significant associations and build predictive models for COVID-19 deaths. Our analysis showed a positive correlation between COVID-19 mortality and demographic factors such as the percentage of the elderly population (&#x3c1;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.44, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05 for the first peak; &#x3c1;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.46, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05 for the second peak). Urbanization was also significantly associated with higher mortality (&#x3c1;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.71, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05 for the first peak; &#x3c1;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.57, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05 for the second peak). Additionally, the prevalence of autoimmune diseases and cancer correlated positively with deaths. An unexpected finding was the positive correlation between improved sanitation (e.g., closed drainage systems and indoor toilets) and COVID-19 mortality. The best-fit multivariate regression model, combining demographics, sanitation, autoimmune diseases, and cancer, achieved an adjusted R<sup>2</sup> of 0.71 for the first peak and 0.85 for the second peak. Our findings suggest that as states become wealthier, they undergo urbanization and infrastructural improvements, including better sanitation. However, these changes may also be associated with a rise in autoimmune diseases and cancer, potentially reducing immune resilience to emerging infections. This study provides novel insights into how improved living conditions and lifestyle changes may paradoxically contribute to increased COVID-19 mortality. By emphasizing the role of immune training in pandemic preparedness, our research offers a new perspective on public health strategies for mitigating future infectious disease outbreaks.\n",

            "Drug repositioning utilizes existing drugs for new therapeutic applications, driven by the rapid increase in disease and drug-related data. However, organizing knowledge in this field and integrating the complex and scattered data from multiple systems into a cohesive knowledge network have become urgent problems to address. In this paper, we propose a drug repositioning model based on knowledge graph embedding. The model employs multivariate relational data to embed entities and relationships in a low-dimensional vector space. It also innovatively introduces the attention mechanism into translation and bilinear models, forming new models such as Attranse, Attdismult, and Attrescal. This model's feature extraction does not rely on a single approach, instead, it integrates multiple models and combines their screening results to enhance drug screening quality. The model's effectiveness was validated using COVID-19 data, yielding results consistent with 7 clinically approved drugs for COVID-19 treatment, indicating high accuracy in identifying new drug indications. The successful application of this model to COVID-19 suggests its potential for broader use in emerging infectious diseases and complex conditions, providing valuable insights for future drug development.\n",

            "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to significant advancements in treatment and vaccination, contributing to a decline in overall COVID-19-related mortality. However, it remains unclear whether the mortality rate for critical cases treated on intensive care units has also decreased. This multicentric, multinational retrospective observational study analyzed 447 critically ill COVID-19 patients treated on ICUs across ten study centers in Germany and Austria. Patients were categorized into two periods: period 1 (March 2020 to May 2021, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;316) and period 2 (June 2021 to January 2022, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;131). Despite evolving treatment strategies and widespread vaccine availability in period 2, 30-day mortality remained unchanged (30% in period 1 vs. 37% in period 2; HR 1.26, 95% CI: 0.90-1.79, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.181). Further outcomes, including ICU-free days (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.735), ventilatory support-free days (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.699), vasopressor-free days (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.379), and dialysis-free days (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.396), also showed no significant differences. Notably, 81% (106 of 131) of ICU patients in period 2 were unvaccinated, underscoring the persistent vulnerability of this group. These findings suggest that while public health measures reduced overall COVID-19 severity, critical illness remained highly lethal. Further research is needed to explore targeted interventions for high-risk ICU patients and to better understand the factors contributing to persistent mortality despite medical advancements.\n",

            "The non-structural protein NS2B plays a critical role in the maturation of Dengue virus (DENV Type 2). The underlying mechanism and the role of NS2B are largely unknown due to the unavailability of its location of activity in the target organelle at single molecule level. This is largely due to the incapability of existing optical microscopes to resolve features beyond the diffraction limit of light ([Formula: see text]), which is limited to a few hundred nanometers. Existing microscopy techniques are at best useful for ensemble study and details at the single molecule level remain hidden. To enable single-molecule resolution, we investigated the role of NS2B protein in a cellular system using scanning single molecule localization microscopy (scanSMLM). Accordingly, a photoactivable plasmid (Dendra2-NS2B) containing the gene-of-interest (NS2B) was constructed and the same is used to transfect NIH3T3 cells. Both super-resolution and confocal imaging studies suggest the accumulation of NS2B proteins in endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Subsequently, single-molecule analysis is carried out, where a total of [Formula: see text] NS2B aggregates (both big and small) are noted with an area-spread of [Formula: see text], the molecular density of [Formula: see text], and an average of [Formula: see text] NS2B molecules per cluster. Moreover, the super-resolved volume image revealed NS2B clusters spreading across several planes with a few extending up to 5 planes ([Formula: see text] from the coverslip). In addition, the collective dynamics of NS2B proteins leading to the formation of clusters is evident from time-lapse super-resolved data that provides conclusive evidence of NS2B accumulation, 24&#xa0;hrs post-transfection. The present study revealed the dynamics of NS2B single viral protein molecule, and its accumulation at ER that may ultimately lead to organelle-specific drug targeting and help to reduce the rate of dengue infection by disrupting the NS2B accumulates.\n",

            "In summer 2021, while the Delta variant was predominant in many European countries, Luxembourg experienced a large outbreak of the P.1.17.1 SARS-CoV-2 Gamma variant. This surge coincided with the introduction of digital COVID-19 certificates and eased restrictions prior to national holiday festivities. We investigated the molecular and epidemiological factors contributing to SARS-CoV-2 Gamma transmission. All laboratory SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases were interviewed by contact tracing teams on exposures at nightlife venues, family gatherings, schools, and workplaces. Gamma sublineages were investigated through environmental wastewater surveillance, in addition to whole genome sequencing of clinical data. Infection clusters were analysed combining phylogenetic with epidemiological exposures. From June 22 to August 12, 2021, we identified 1,049 cases of the Gamma P.1.17.1 sublineage, representing 39.2% of all sequenced cases. Initially, nightlife was the most frequent source setting (49.1%) with young adults accounting for 92.3% of these cases. Later, transmission shifted towards family (30.4%) setting with a corresponding increase in the age distribution. The C26645T mutation in the M-protein was associated with attending specific nightclub venues. Notably, 96.8% of cases were in unvaccinated individuals, and while P.1.17.1 was also detected in neighboring countries, 75.6% of the sequences submitted to GISAID were from Luxembourg. The study suggests the role of nightlife and low population immunity in driving the summer surge of SARS-CoV-2 among young adults, with digital certificates showing minimal impact on transmission. Sequencing of clinical and wastewater samples in combination with contact tracing was crucial to inform the outbreak investigation.\n",

Randomised trials have provided inconclusive results on the optimal dosage of thromboprophylaxis in critically ill COVID-19 patients. We utilized data from the multicentre CAPACITY-COVID patient registry to assess the effect of differential application of Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) dose protocols on PE and in-hospital mortality risk in critically ill COVID-19 patients. An instrumental variable analysis was performed to estimate the intention-to-treat effect, utilizing differences in thromboprophylaxis prescribing behaviour between hospitals. We included 939 patients with PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 34 hospitals. Two-hundred-and-one patients (21%) developed a PE. The adjusted cause-specific HR of PE was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.73-1.16) per doubling of LMWH dose. The adjusted cause-specific HR for in-hospital mortality was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.65-1.02) per doubling of LMWH dose. This dose-response relationship was shown to be non-linear. To conclude, this study did not find evidence for an effect of LMWH dose on the risk of PE, but suggested a non-linear decreased risk of in-hospital mortality for higher doses of LMWH. However, uncertainty remains, and the dose-response relationship between LMWH dose and in-hospital mortality needs further investigation in well-designed studies.\n",

            "Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV) are zoonotic filoviruses that cause hemorrhagic fever in humans. Correlative data implicate bats as natural EBOV hosts, but neither a full-length genome nor an EBOV isolate has been found in any bats sampled. Here, we model filovirus infection in the Jamaican fruit bat (JFB), Artibeus jamaicensis, by inoculation with either EBOV or MARV through a combination of oral, intranasal, and subcutaneous routes. Infection with EBOV results in systemic virus replication and oral shedding of infectious virus. MARV replication is transient and does not shed. In vitro, JFB cells replicate EBOV more efficiently than MARV, and MARV infection induces innate antiviral responses that EBOV efficiently suppresses. Experiments using VSV pseudoparticles or replicating VSV expressing the EBOV or MARV glycoprotein demonstrate an advantage for EBOV entry and replication early, respectively, in JFB cells. Overall, this study describes filovirus species-specific phenotypes for both JFB and their cells.\n",

            "Mosquito-borne diseases pose a significant public health threat, particularly in densely populated urban areas. Climate change, urbanization, and global connectivity have fueled the expansion of mosquitoes and their associated pathogens, increasing the disease burden. Harris County, Texas, is among the most vulnerable regions in the United States for mosquito-borne disease outbreaks, underscoring the critical need for localized insights into mosquito population dynamics to inform vector surveillance and control strategies. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the population dynamics of mosquito species in Harris County by exploring their species composition, spatial distribution, and seasonal patterns. Our findings reveal the extensive distribution of Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes albopictus, with Aedes aegypti concentrated in highly urbanized areas. Notably, three of the five most abundant species are primary vectors of human pathogens, highlighting the urgent need for targeted interventions. By leveraging high-resolution surveillance data, this research deepens our understanding of mosquito dynamics and lays the groundwork for future studies investigating the effects of climate change, urbanization, and other environmental drivers on vector populations.\n",

            "COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, affects multiple body systems, including the oral cavity, where it may disrupt the oral microbiome in ways that contribute to disease pathology. Understanding the long-term interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the oral microbiome is crucial, as it may reveal microbial markers valuable for diagnosing or monitoring persistent health issues in COVID-19 survivors. Metagenomic sequencing revealed significant microbial shifts in the oral microbiome of COVID-19 patients, showing reduced microbial diversity and increased prevalence of opportunistic pathogens compared to healthy individuals. Alpha diversity measures indicated lower microbial diversity and evenness, while beta diversity analyses demonstrated distinct microbial community compositions. Core microbiome analysis identified unique taxa in COVID-19 patients that may contribute to disease pathology, while differential abundance analysis highlighted specific taxa shifts, including an increase in potential pathogens. Our findings advance the understanding of microbial changes in the oral microbiome associated with COVID-19 and suggest potential targets for microbiome-based interventions. While these results indicate associations with possible health impacts, further research is needed to determine causative links and long-term implications for COVID-19 survivors. This foundational research highlights the potential for microbiome science to inform diagnostic tools, such as microbial markers for disease progression, and therapeutic approaches, including targeted probiotics, which could ultimately support better patient outcomes and public health strategies.\n",

            "An outbreak of mpox has triggered concerns regarding the adequacy of intervention strategies. Passive immunity conferred by neutralizing antibodies exhibits potential in the prophylaxis and treatment of orthopoxvirus infections. Despite this, the investigations of effective antibody therapeutics have been hindered by the varied nature of orthopoxvirus envelope proteins and the intricate mechanisms underpinning viral invasion. Our study involves the production of six mpox virus (MPXV) envelope proteins, which are relatively conservative and considered to play a role in the neutralization process. We employed a synthetic nanobody (Nb) library to derive a broad array of specific Nbs against these viral proteins. We identified a cross-reactive Nb, termed M1R-01, which targets the M1R protein and effectively neutralizes both vaccinia virus (VACV) and MPXV. Notably, the M1R-01-based antibody strategy provided optimal protection against a lethal VACV challenge in mice. Additionally, we determined the crystal structure of the M1R-Nb complex, uncovering novel binding attributes of M1R-01 and detailed conformational epitope information. This work provides a promising candidate for the therapy and prophylaxis of orthopoxvirus infections.\n",

            "Understanding flavivirus immunity is critical for the development of pan-flavivirus vaccines. Dendritic cells (DC) coordinate antiviral innate and adaptive immune responses, and they can be targeted by flaviviruses as a mechanism of immune evasion. Using an unbiased genome-wide approach designed to specifically identify flavivirus-modulated pathways, we found that, while dengue virus (DENV) robustly activates DCs, Zika virus (ZIKV) causes minimal activation of genes involved in DC activation, maturation, and antigen presentation, reducing cytokine secretion and the stimulation of allogeneic and peptide-specific T cell responses. Mechanistically, ZIKV inhibits DC maturation by suppressing NF-&#x3ba;B p65 recruitment and the subsequent transcription of proinflammatory and DC maturation-related genes. Thus, we identify a divergence in the effects of ZIKV and DENV on the host T cell response, highlighting the need to factor such differences into the design of anti-flavivirus vaccines.\n",

Here we develop a kinetically engineered vaccine (KE-VAC) that mimics the multidimensional immunomodulation in natural infections via dynamic activation of antigen presenting cells with masked TLR7/8 agonist and sustained supplies of antigens and adjuvants to lymph nodes, leading to follicular helper T and germinal centre B cell activation in vaccinated mice. KE-VAC demonstrates superior efficacy than traditional alum and mRNA vaccines, achieving a 100% survival rate with increased neutralizing antibodies titers and polyfunctional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, recognizing heterologous SARS-CoV-2 variants, and inducing broad and long-term protection against multiple strains of influenza viruses. Prime/boost vaccination with KE-VAC also protect aged ferrets from severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus infection, with no virus detected in any organs at day 6 p.i. The efficacy of KE-VAC across various pathogens thus highlights its potential as an effective vaccine against emerging infectious risks.\n",

We estimated the annual relative odds of Ebolavirus spillover during 2021 and 2022. The highest relative spillover odds estimates occurred in patches that closely followed the spatial distribution of forest loss and fragmentation. Regions throughout equatorial Africa had increased spillover estimates related to changes in forests and human populations. Spillover events in 2022 occurred in locations in the top 0.1% of overall spillover odds estimates or where estimates increased from 2021 to 2022.

            "With the near eradication of poliovirus due to global vaccination campaigns, attention has shifted to other enteroviruses that can cause polio-like paralysis syndrome (now termed acute flaccid myelitis (AFM))<sup>1-3</sup>. In particular, enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is believed to be the main driver of epidemic outbreaks of AFM in recent years<sup>4</sup>, yet not much is known about EV-D68 host interactions. EV-D68 is a respiratory virus<sup>5</sup> but, in rare cases, can spread to the central nervous system to cause severe neuropathogenesis. Here, we used genome-scale CRISPR screens to identify the poorly characterized multipass membrane transporter MFSD6 as a host entry factor for EV-D68. Knockout of MFSD6 expression abrogated EV-D68 infection in cell lines and primary cells corresponding to respiratory and neural cells. MFSD6 localized to the plasma membrane and was required for viral entry into host cells. MFSD6 bound directly to EV-D68 particles via its third extracellular loop (L3). We determined the cryo-EM structure of EV-D68 in complex with L3 at 2.1 &#xc5; resolution, revealing the interaction interface. A decoy receptor, engineered by fusing MFSD6(L3) to Fc, blocked EV-D68 infection of human primary lung epithelial cells, and provided near complete protection in a lethal mouse model of EV-D68 infection. Collectively, our results reveal MFSD6 as an entry receptor for EV-D68, and support targeting MFSD6 as a potential mechanism to combat infections by this emerging pathogen with pandemic potential.\n",

            "In a phase 1 clinical trial, a chimeric hemagglutinin (cHA) immunogen induced antibody responses against the conserved hemagglutinin (HA) stalk domain as designed. Here, we determined the specificity, function, and subsets of B cells induced by cHA vaccination by pairing single-cell RNA sequencing and B cell receptor repertoire sequencing. We have shown that the cHA-inactivated vaccine with a squalene-based adjuvant induced a robust activated B cell and memory B cell (MBC) phenotype against two broadly neutralizing epitopes in the stalk domain. The overall specificities of the acute plasmablast (PB) and MBC responses clonally overlapped, suggesting B cell convergence to these broadly protective epitopes. At 1 year post immunization, we identified that cHA vaccination reshaped the HA-specific MBC pool to enrich for stalk-binding B cells. Altogether, these data indicate the cHA vaccine induced robust and durable B cell responses against broadly protective epitopes of the HA stalk domain, in line with serological data.\n",

            "Virus symptom expression involves complex interactions between viruses and their hosts, including antiviral defenses and counter-defenses, many of which are not well understood. This study utilizes Neurospora crassa as a model organism to investigate the role of RNA editing in the fungal antiviral response. We identify two adjacent genes in the genome: the A-to-I RNA-editing enzyme, OTT_1508-like deaminase (old), and its target, zinc fingers adjacent to old (zao). These genes regulate the transcriptional response to viral infection, with old modulating the expression of zao, which functions as a master transcription factor. This regulation contributes to asymptomatic infections by maintaining normal growth and development. However, in RNAi-deficient conditions, the overactivation of these genes leads to severe symptoms, akin to hypersensitive responses&#xa0;observed in plants. Additionally, homologs of zao-old are found as genomic neighbors in various filamentous ascomycetes, suggesting that this RNA-editing system may represent an evolutionarily conserved antiviral mechanism.\n",

            "Early detection of viral infection and rapid activation of host antiviral defenses through transcriptional upregulation of interferons (IFNs) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) are critical for controlling infection. However, aberrant production of IFN in the absence of viral infection leads to auto-inflammation and can be detrimental to the host. Here, we show that the DNA-binding transcriptional repressor complex composed of Capicua (CIC) and Ataxin-1 like (ATXN1L) binds to an 8-nucleotide motif near IFN and ISG promoters and prevents erroneous expression of inflammatory genes under homeostasis in humans and mice. By contrast, during respiratory viral infection, activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway results in rapid degradation of the CIC-ATXN1L complex, thereby relieving repression and allowing for robust induction of IFN and ISGs. Together, our studies define a new paradigm for host regulation of IFN and ISGs through the evolutionarily conserved CIC-ATXN1L transcriptional repressor complex during homeostasis and viral infection.\n",

Viral integration can lead to structural variation, gene dysfunction, and genome instability, promoting tumorigenesis. To support the investigation of virus-associated cancer and improve the detection of virus infection, we developed an algorithm called AVID (accurate viral integration detector) for viral integration detection. AVID was built by overcoming the existing detection limitations, enhancing sensitivity and accuracy, and expanding additional functions of viral integration detection. The performance of AVID was estimated&#xa0;in simulated datasets and experimentally validated datasets compared with other tools. To demonstrate its wide applicability, we also tested AVID on viral integration detection in multiple oncovirus-associated human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cervical cancer, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Taken together, our study developed an improved and applicable tool for viral integration detection and visualization to facilitate further exploration of virus-infected diseases.\n",

This study aimed to address this gap. Data from the World Health Organization pharmacovigilance database (1968-2024; total reports = 8,909,484) were used. Reporting odds ratios (RORs) and information components (ICs) were calculated to assess the association between each drug and CVST. In total, 851 cases were identified as vaccine-associated CVST, of which 527 (61.93%) occurred in female patients. Only Ad5-vectored COVID-19 vaccines had the highest ROR and IC value with CVST (ROR, 4.78; 95% confidence interval, 4.34-5.28; IC, 2.15). The risk of CVST increased with age, with the 45-64-years age group having an IC of 1.35, while the 65 years and older group had a higher IC of 2.08. The findings highlight the need for clinicians to recognize the potential risks of CVST and prioritize rigorous monitoring and research to ensure patient safety.\n",

            "Currently, there are no clinically approved antiviral agents against dengue-virus (DENV). This study aimed to determine the prophylactic, antiviral, and therapeutic potential of quercetin by its pre-treatment, co-treatment, and post-treatment [24, 48, and 72&#xa0;h-post-infection (HPI)] of DENV-infected Balb/C mice through both oral and intraperitoneal (I.P) route, respectively. 80&#xa0;mg/kg/day and 16&#xa0;mg/kg/day of quercetin were non-toxic for oral and I.P administration, respectively. I.P. was found to be more effective than oral administration which significantly reduced DENV copy-number in co-treatment group (from day 1, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01); post-treatment (24hpi),and pretreatment groups (day 3 onwards, p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). Molecular-docking experiments indicated quercetin could act as a double-edged sword by strongly interacting with DENV envelope-glycoprotein (-8.1&#xa0;kcal/mol) and NS5-RdRp domain (-8.0&#xa0;kcal/mol), which are crucial for viral-attachment and replication. MD-simulation of docked complexes indicated their stability defined by low RMSD, RMSF, and stable H-bond with active-site residues. Significant reduction (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) in TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-6, ROS-production, and vascular leakage was observed among pre-, co-, and post-treatment (24 and 48 HPI) groups with promising hepatic and renal-protective effects. Pharmacological and functional-molecular interaction networks indicate a significant effect of quercetin on vascular integrity byVEGF-KDR signaling pathway (via PI3K-Akt and Ras signalling), oxygen homeostasis through HIF-1 signalling, and the anti-inflammatory response via PI3K-Akt, IL-6 and its receptor signalling (PPI enrichment P&#xa0;=&#xa0;3.19e-10).Thus, it can be concluded that I.P. co- and post-treatment (24hpi) of quercetin to DENV-infected mice could effectively reduce viral-titer, pro-inflammatory cytokines, ROS-response, and vascular permeability. Taken together this demonstrates quercetin as an important antiviral candidate against dengue.\n",

            "Senecavirus A (SVA) is an emerging swine virus with global prevalence that causes vesicular disease (VD), clinically similar to foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), posing a significant concern for the swine industry. The capsid protein VP2 is a structural protein of SVA, playing a critical role in mediating viral entry into host cells and inducing the production of neutralizing antibodies. In this study, the SVA VP2 protein was expressed using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system. Six monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting SVA VP2 protein were then produced by immunizing mice with the recombinant VP2 protein, named as 1A1F6, 3D5F9, 3E2C3, 5A6F5, 5F12D10 and 7H10C3, respectively. Among these, mAbs 1A1F6 and 7H10C3 exhibited neutralizing activity against SVA in vitro with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.64&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/mL and 1.21&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/mL, respectively. Finally, a linear B-cell neutralizing epitope of <sup>151</sup>SLQELN<sup>156</sup> on the SVA VP2 protein was identified by determining the reactivity of the neutralizing mAbs with the truncated VP2 protein followed by peptide scanning. Peptide mutation analysis showed that the residues Ser<sup>151</sup>, Leu<sup>152</sup>, Leu<sup>155</sup>, and Asn<sup>156</sup> within the epitope were essential for antibody binding. Multiple sequence alignment indicated that this epitope is highly conserved across various SVA strains. These findings provide a foundation for further studies on SVA and offer valuable support for the design of SVA vaccines.\n",

            "The COVID-19 pandemic revealed global disparities in accessing medical countermeasures, as high-income countries prioritised their own interests while disregarding low- and middle-income countries. Despite global efforts to ensure an equitable pandemic response, these initiatives largely failed to achieve their objectives for LMICs due to systemic inequalities. This review critically examines these disparities, identifying that excessive stockpiling by HICs, fragmented international coordination, inadequate research and manufacturing capacity, restricted access to emergency research funding, intellectual property constraints, unequal participation in clinical trials, and inadequate regulatory harmonisation collectively hinder LMICs ability to respond effectively. By analysing diverse case scenarios and global response strategies, all plausible key shortcomings that contributed to the failure of coordinated pandemic preparedness were highlighted. Based on these insights, actionable strategies are proposed to address these gaps in LMICs so as to ensure affordability, accessibility, and equitable distribution of vaccines, diagnostics, and biotherapeutics in future public health emergencies, strengthening global biosecurity.\n",

The relationship between the usage of personal listening devices and hearing acuity will be examined. The relation between hours of personal listening devices use, volume levels, and self-report measures will additionally be explored. A total of 65 students from the University of Jordan were recruited. A full audiological tests battery including; routine puretone audiometry, extended high-frequency audiometry, and distortion product otoacoustic emissions, was conducted. Also, students were asked to fill the Arabic version of Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) questionnaire and Hyperacusis Questionnaire (HQ). The use of personal listening devices does not seem to be related to the hearing threshold in the standard frequency range of 0.25-8&#x2009;kHz for the majority of participants in this study. Using high-frequency audiometry, current results indicated a significant association between the usage of personal listening device and hearing thresholds at 18 and 20&#x2009;kHz. While the distortion product otoacoustic emissions results showed that the signal to noise ratio (SNR) was affected (SNR&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;6 dB) in only 20% of the students. With online learning becoming widely accepted as a standard educational approach post COVID-19, there is an anticipated surge in the usage of personal listening devices. Understanding the potential impact of this transition on the auditory well-being of students is crucial for ensuring their overall health and academic success. The use of personal listening devices for online learning might introduce potential risks to hearing and could align with the unsafe listening practices observed among young adults.\n",

            "Mosquito-transmitted viruses of the genus Orthoflavivirus impose a significant public health burden in many tropical and sub-tropical countries around the world, yet there is still no therapeutic drug to treat infection by any of these viruses, and so a deeper understanding of the mechanism of viral replication is required to identify potential therapeutic targets. Studies have shown that lipid metabolism is modulated upon virus infection, and that fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a key enzyme in fatty acid biosynthesis. In particular it has been reported that FASN interacts with DENV NS3 and is subsequently located to the replication complex. To further investigate this, the interaction of FASN with NS3 and NS5 of the Orthoflaviviruses dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) was investigated by coimmunoprecipitation and indirect immunofluorescent assay. Unexpectedly, FASN interacted with both NS3 and NS5 independently. The colocalization of NS3 and FASN was found for all investigated viruses, and while NS5 interacted with FASN, colocalization was not observed. Markedly however, FASN colocalized with dsRNA, a marker for the replication complex. FASN is an essential enzyme and plays a role in viral replication complex and cellular membrane remodelling. The interaction of FASN with both NS3 and NS5, as well as some of FASN being localized to the site of replication for DENV, JEV and ZIKV further highlights FASN as an important therapeutic target which may have applications to many mosquito-transmitted Orthoflaviviruses.\n",

            "Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti) is the primary vector of several arboviruses, including dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). This vector is widespread globally in tropical and subtropical areas but also found in temperate areas. Kenya experienced its first chikungunya outbreak in Lamu County in 2004, followed by subsequent outbreaks in Mandera in 2016 and Mombasa in 2017. Despite the presence of Ae. aegypti in Kisumu and Busia counties, no outbreaks of chikungunya fever have been reported in these two western Kenya counties. To investigate this phenomenon, we collected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes from the county headquarter towns of Kisumu and Busia. The mosquitoes were reared under controlled laboratory conditions, and their genetic diversity assessed using COI gene sequences. Additionally, neutrality tests, including Tajima's D and Fu's FS, were subsequently performed to infer evolutionary dynamics. The mosquitoes were then evaluated for their ability to transmit CHIKV by challenging laboratory-reared F1 generations of field-collected mosquitoes with an infectious blood meal containing CHIKV. Genetic analysis revealed the presence of both Ae. aegypti subspecies, (Ae. aegypti aegypti [Aaa] and Ae. aegypti formosus [Aaf]) in the two western Kenya counties, with Aaf being dominant (19:8 for Kisumu samples and 25:6 for Busia samples). The populations exhibited high haplotype diversity (0.96011 in Kisumu and 0.93763 in Busia) and low nucleotide diversity (0.00913 in Kisumu and 0.00757 in Busia), indicating significant genetic polymorphism at the loci examined. Additionally, negative neutrality tests, including Tajima's D (-1.87530 for Kisumu and -1.09547 for Busia) and Fu's FS (-10.223 for Kisumu and -15.249 for Busia), coupled with a smooth mismatch distribution, suggest that recent evolutionary events may have significantly shaped the genetic structure of these populations. The assessment of vector competence of Ae. aegypti populations from Kisumu and Busia counties revealed their capacity to support CHIKV transmission. Specifically, we demonstrated infection, dissemination, and transmission rates of 55.2%, 85.5%, and 27.1% for Kisumu, and 57.8%, 71.8%, and 25% for Busia, respectively. However, statistical analysis indicated no significant difference in vector competence between the two populations. These findings underscore the uniform potential of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes from both Kisumu and Busia to facilitate the spread of CHIKV, highlighting the need for consistent surveillance and vector management strategies across these regions.\n",

            "Human health depends on perplexing defensive cellular responses against microbial pathogens like Viruses. Despite the major effort undertaken, the (epi)genomic mechanisms that human cells utilize to tailor defensive gene expression programs against microbial attacks have remained inadequately understood, mainly due to a significant lack of recording of the in vivo functional cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) of the human genome. Here, we introduce the virus-responsive fate of the human (epi)genome as characterized in na&#xef;ve and infected cells by functional genomics, computational biology, DNA evolution, and DNA Grammar and Syntax investigations. We discovered that multitudes of novel functional virus-responsive CRMs (vrCRMs) compose typical enhancers (tEs), super-enhancers (SEs),&#xa0;repetitive-DNA enhancers (rDEs), and stand-alone functional genomic stretches that grant human cells regulatory underpinnings for layering basal immunity and eliminating illogical/harmful defensive responses under homeostasis, yet stimulating virus-responsive genes and transposable elements (TEs) upon infection. Moreover, extensive epigenomic reprogramming of previously unknown SE landscapes marks the transition from na&#xef;ve to antiviral human cell states and involves the functions of the antimicrobial transcription factors (TFs), including interferon response factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-&#x3ba;B (NF-&#x3ba;B), as well as coactivators and transcriptional apparatus, along with intensive modifications/alterations in histone marks and chromatin accessibility. Considering the polyphyletic evolutionary fingerprints of the composite DNA sequences of the vrCRMs assessed by TFs-STARR-seq, ranging from the animal to microbial kingdoms, the conserved features of antimicrobial TFs and chromatin complexes, and their pluripotent stimulus-induced activation, these findings shed light on how mammalian (epi)genomes evolved their functions to interpret the exogenous stress inflicted and program defensive transcriptional responses against microbial agents. Crucially, many known human short variants, e.g. single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions etc., and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) linked to autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Crohn's disease (CD) etc., were mapped within or vastly proximal (&#xb1;2.5 kb) to the novel in vivo functional SEs and vrCRMs discovered, thus underscoring the impact of their (mal)functions on human physiology and disease development. Hence, we delved into the virus-responsive fate of the human (epi)genome and illuminated its architecture, function, evolutionary origins, and its significance for cellular homeostasis. These results allow us to chart the \"Human hyper-Atlas of virus-infection\",&#xa0;an integrated \"molecular in silico\" encyclopedia situated in the UCSC Genome Browser that benefits our mechanistic understanding of human infectious/(auto)immune diseases development and can facilitate the generation of in vivo preclinical animal models, drug design, and evolution of therapeutic applications.\n",

            "Coordinated expression of differentiation and innate pathways is essential for successful mucosal injury-repair. Previously, we discovered that the core SWI/SNF complex ATPase, SWI/SNF-related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A, member 4 (SMARCA4)/Brg1, maintains tumor protein 63&#xa0;+&#xa0;basal progenitor cells in an epithelial-committed state. In response to viral injury, SMARCA4 complexes BRD4 to activate innate inflammation and promote mesenchymal transition/plasticity. To investigate how innate inflammation couples with plasticity, Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease of BRD4 binding was applied to wild type and SMARCA4 knockdown (KD) in mock- or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-infected basal cells. In mock-infected cells, BRD4 binds 4017 high-confidence peaks within gene bodies controlling mesenchymal transition pathways. By contrast, RSV replication repositions 2339 BRD4 peaks to open chromatin regions upstream of the genes controlling inducible cytokine, cell adherence, and antiviral programs. Also, we note RSV redistributes BRD4 into super enhancers regulating immune response-associated long noncoding (lnc)RNAs. In SMARCA4 KD cells, BRD4 distribution is reduced on 739 peaks after RSV infection. The boundaries of nucleosome-free regions are reduced by SMARCA4 KD, suggesting its role in maintaining open chromatin of super enhancers. Specifically, SMARCA4-BRD4 enhancer controls lncRNAs important in interferon response factor 1 autoregulation. These data indicate how SWI/SNF ATPases couple BRD4 to lncRNA expression controlling cell state and intrinsic immunity in epithelial injury-repair.\n",

Its genome shares similarities with other marseilleviruses. Helium ion microscopy and electron microscopy of infected cells unraveled stages of the Jyvaskylavirus life cycle. We reconstructed the Jyvaskylavirus particle to 6.3 &#xc5; resolution using cryo-electron microscopy. The ~2500 &#xc5; diameter virion displays structural similarities to other Marseilleviridae giant viruses. The capsid comprises of 9240 copies of the major capsid protein, encoded by open reading frame (ORF) 184, which possesses a double jellyroll fold arranged in trimers forming pseudo-hexameric capsomers. Below the capsid shell, the internal membrane vesicle encloses the genome. Through cross-structural and -sequence comparisons with other Marseilleviridae using AI-based software in model building and prediction, we elucidated ORF142 as the penton protein, which plugs the 12 vertices of the capsid. Five additional ORFs were identified, with models predicted and fitted into densities that either cap the capsomers externally or stabilize them internally. The isolation of Jyvaskylavirus suggests that these viruses may be widespread in the boreal environment and provide structural insights extendable to other marseilleviruses.\n",

            "Interleukin-35 (IL-35) has an immunosuppressive function through the regulation of immune cells during infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, and cancers. The modulatory role of IL-35 in T lymphocytes, which are involved in host immune responses during human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection, has not been elucidated. The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of regulatory function of IL-35 to T-cell activity in patients living with chronic HIV-1 infection. Sixty-seven patients living with chronic HIV-1 infection and 17 controls were enrolled in the study. IL-35 levels were measured via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Purified CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were stimulated with recombinant human IL-35. The secretion of cytokines and cytotoxic molecules, the mRNA levels of IL-35 receptor subunits and transcription factors, the expression of immune checkpoint molecules, and cell proliferation were assessed to evaluate the effect of IL-35 on T lymphocyte function <i>in vitro</i>. Compared with controls, patients living with chronic HIV-1 infection presented increased plasma IL-35 levels. IL-35 stimulation did not affect either the expression of IL-35 receptor subunits or the proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from either patients living with chronic HIV-1 infection or controls. IL-35 stimulation downregulated transcription factor mRNA expression and cytokine secretion by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as well as cytotoxic molecule production by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from both patients living with chronic HIV-1 infection and controls. This process was accompanied by increased expression of immune checkpoint molecules on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The addition of IL-35 also reduced perforin and granzyme B secretion by HIV-1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from patients living with chronic HIV-1 infection. Increased plasma IL-35 in patients living with chronic HIV-1 infection might dampen the activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, leading to T-cell exhaustion.\n",

            "Background The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) criteria have not been validated for patients with noncirrhotic chronic hepatitis C (CHC), who are at a greater risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than the general population. Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic performance of LI-RADS category 5 (LR-5, indicating definite HCC) observations for HCC using CT and MRI in patients with noncirrhotic CHC and to compare these findings with those in patients with cirrhotic CHC. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients without cirrhosis with CHC with focal hepatic nodules of 1 cm or greater on dynamic CT or MRI scans who underwent pathologic confirmation at two university hospitals from August 2002 to February 2022. This group served as the test dataset. The primary outcome was the diagnostic performance of LR-5 for HCC using CT and MRI. When LI-RADS categorization differed between CT and MRI, the MRI-based classification was used as the definitive category. Results were validated using a dataset of patients with CHC from two additional hospitals based on the clinical composite reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. Results The test dataset comprised 458 patients (mean age, 64 years &#xb1; 9 [SD]; 350 male; 219 without cirrhosis, 239 with cirrhosis). For noncirrhotic livers, the LR-5 criteria achieved an AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.93), 85.1% (95% CI: 80.6, 89.7), 82.4% (95% CI: 77.0, 87.8), 97.6% (95% CI: 93.0, 100.0), 99.4% (95% CI: 98.2, 100.0), and 54.7% (95% CI: 43.4, 65.9), respectively. The AUC for LR-5 observations in diagnosing HCC was higher in the noncirrhotic liver group compared with the cirrhotic liver group (AUC, 0.90 [95% CI: 0.86, 0.93] vs 0.79 [95% CI: 0.74, 0.84]; <i>P</i> = .002). The diagnostic performance of the LR-5 criteria for diagnosing HCC was also excellent in patients with noncirrhotic CHC in the validation dataset, which included 155 lesions from 103 patients (mean age, 68 years &#xb1; 12; 146 male). The AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV in the validation dataset were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.97), 96.1% (95% CI: 93.1, 99.2), 82.9% (95% CI: 70.4, 95.3), 100%, 100%, and 95.2% (95% CI: 91.5, 99.0), respectively. Conclusion The diagnostic performance of LR-5 for HCC in patients with noncirrhotic CHC was comparable to that in patients with cirrhosis across various clinical settings. &#xa9; RSNA, 2025 <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i> See also the editorial by Sch&#xf6;llnast in this issue.\n",

            "Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a viral infectious disease that affects cattle and causes significant economic losses, particularly in low and medium income countries, where livestock is often the main source of income for small-scale farmers and rural communities. In the last few years, the disease has become widespread in several countries in Asia, including Pakistan. The present cross-sectional study aimed to determine the seroprevalence and molecular characteristics of LSD virus (LSDV) among cattle in the Bahawalpur district (Pakistan), while identifying potential associated risk factors. A total of 400 serum samples were collected from cattle and analysed using a commercial ELISA kit to determine seroprevalence. Additionally, 12 skin scrapping samples of cattle were collected from sick animals to detect and characterize the currently potentially circulating LSDV strains using PCR, targeting the P32 gene. The overall LSD seroprevalence among cattle was found to be 38.0%, with significant variation observed between different geographical areas of the Bahawalpur district, showing the highest prevalence of 46.2% in Yazman Tehsil. Age and feeding system were identified as significant risk factors for LSD occurrence in cattle. The genetic analysis revealed a high genomic similarity between the LSDV strain sequences reported in Asian and Middle Eastern countries. The P32 gene phylogenetic analysis further confirmed the close relationship between LSDV sequences from Pakistan and vaccine strains of sheep and goat pox viruses. The present study provides important baseline information for an understanding of the epidemiology and characterisation of LSDV enzootic strains in Pakistan, and highlights the need for effective disease control strategies, including vaccination campaigns, particularly in disease-endemic regions.\n",

            "The West African country of Ghana boasts a stable democracy and diverse culture. Although strides have been made in education and healthcare access, challenges persist, particularly in rural communities. The physician associate (PA) profession emerged in the 1960s to address healthcare shortages, with formal training programs established and accreditation overseen by the Ghana Tertiary Education Commission and the Medical and Dental Council. PAs play a critical role in healthcare delivery, providing services in both urban and rural areas. Ghana's healthcare system, while advancing, is concentrated in urban centers, necessitating task-sharing strategies for improved access. Health outcomes have improved, but maternal and child mortality remain high. PAs contribute significantly to Ghana's healthcare system, including reproductive health and primary care services, alongside efforts to combat epidemics such as COVID-19. Key concerns for PAs include career progression, resource allocation, and public understanding of their role. Despite challenges, PAs remain essential in providing care to underserved populations. Addressing concerns and supporting PAs are vital for sustainable and effective healthcare in Ghana.\n",

            "DNA viruses at once elicit and commandeer host pathways, including DNA repair pathways, for virus replication. Despite encoding its own DNA polymerase and processivity factor, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) recruits the cellular processivity factor, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and specialized host DNA polymerases involved in translesion synthesis (TLS) to replication compartments (RCs) where viral DNA (vDNA) is synthesized. While the recruitment of TLS polymerases is important for viral genome stability, the role of PCNA is poorly understood. PCNA function in DNA repair is regulated by monoubiquitination (mUb) or SUMOylation of PCNA at lysine 164 (K164). We find that mUb-PCNA increases over the course of infection, and modification of K164 is required for PCNA-mediated restriction of virus replication. mUb-PCNA plays important known roles in recruiting TLS polymerases to DNA, which we have shown are important for viral genome integrity and diversity, represented by structural variants and single nucleotide variants (SNVs), respectively. We find that PCNA drives SNVs on vDNA similar to Y-family TLS polymerases, but this did not require modification at K164. Unlike TLS polymerases, depeletion of PCNA did not result in large-scale rearrangements on vDNA. These striking results suggest separable PCNA-dependent and -independent functions of TLS polymerases on vDNA. By extension, these results imply roles for TLS polymerase beyond their canonical function in TLS in host biology. These findings highlight PCNA as a complex restriction factor for HCMV infection, likely with multiple distinct roles, and provide new insights into the PCNA-mediated regulation of DNA synthesis and repair in viral infection.IMPORTANCEGenome synthesis is a critical step of virus life cycles and a major target of antiviral drugs. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), like other herpesviruses, encodes machinery sufficient for viral DNA synthesis and relies on host factors for efficient replication. We have shown that host DNA repair factors play important roles in HCMV replication, but our understanding of this is incomplete. Building on previous findings that specialized host DNA polymerases contribute to HCMV genome integrity and diversity, we sought to determine the importance of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), the central polymerase regulator. PCNA is associated with nascent viral DNA and restricts HCMV replication. While PCNA is dispensable for genome integrity, it contributes to genome diversity. Our findings suggest that host polymerases function on viral genomes by separable PCNA-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Through revealing complex roles for PCNA in HCMV replication, this study expands the repertoire of host DNA synthesis and repair proteins hijacked by this ubiquitous herpesvirus.\n",

            "Unexpected outbreaks caused by the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) in dairy cows in the United States (US) have raised significant veterinary and public health concerns. When and how the H5N1 HPAIV was introduced into dairy cows and the broader epidemiology of influenza A virus (IAV) infections in cattle in the US remain unclear. Herein, we performed a retrospective study to screen more than 1,700 cattle serum samples collected from different bovine breeds in the US from January 2023 to May 2024 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) targeting the nucleoprotein (NP) to detect IAV infections, and the positive samples were further tested by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. Results showed that 586 of 1,724 samples (33.99%) from 15 US states were seropositive by the NP ELISA assay, including 78 samples collected in 2024 and 508 samples collected in 2023. Moreover, the HI assay revealed that 45 of these ELISA-positive samples were positive to human seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 and swine H3N2 and H1N2 viruses, and some were positive to two or three tested IAVs. Surprisingly, none of these ELISA-positive samples were HI positive for the circulating bovine H5N1 strain. Our results demonstrate that IAVs other than H5N1 can infect cattle, infections are not limited to dairy cows, and that bovine infections with swine and human IAVs have occurred prior to the H5N1 outbreaks. All results highlight the value in monitoring IAV epidemiology in cattle, as the viruses might adapt to cattle and/or reassort with the currently circulating H5N1 HPAIV, increasing risk to humans.IMPORTANCEInfluenza A virus (IAV) is an important zoonotic pathogen that can infect different species. Although cattle were not historically considered vulnerable to IAV infections, an unexpected outbreak caused by H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in dairy cows in the United States (US) in early 2024 has raised significant concerns. When and how the virus was introduced into dairy cows and the wider impact of IAV infections in cattle in the US remain unclear. Our retrospective serological screen provided evidence of human and swine H1 and H3 IAV infections in different cattle breeds in addition to dairy cows, although no H5N1 infection was detected. Our results underline the necessity to monitor IAV epidemiology in cattle, as reassortment of IAVs from different species may occur in cattle, generating novel viruses that pose threats to public and animal health.\n",

            "SLC35B4, a nucleotide sugar transporter that mediates the transport of UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-xylose, was found to be required for the replication of influenza A virus (IAV) of the H5N1 subtype in our genome-wide siRNA library screen. We found that defective IAV replication in SLC35B4-deficient A549 cells was independent of virus strain specificity, and the virulence of IAV in Slc35b4 knockdown mice was also decreased. By examining the individual stages of the IAV replication cycle, we discovered that the amount of internalized IAV was significantly reduced in SLC35B4-knockout A549 cells. Mechanistically, SLC35B4 facilitated IAV replication by transporting UDP-xylose, which attaches to the serine residue of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in the heparan sulfate (HS) biosynthesis pathway. Knockdown of associated host factors (i.e., XYLT2, B4GALT7, EXT1, and EXT2) in the HS biosynthesis pathway also impaired IAV replication. Furthermore, we revealed that AGRN, a unique HSPG family member, was important for the endocytosis of IAV in A549 cells. Moreover, we found that the homeostasis of the AGRN protein was regulated by HS modification mediated by the initial UDP-xylose transporter SLC35B4, thereby affecting the expression level of endocytic adapter AP2B1 to influence IAV internalization. Collectively, these findings establish that SLC35B4 is an important regulator of IAV replication and uncover the underlying mechanisms by which SLC35B4 employs UDP-xylose transport activity to promote IAV internalization.IMPORTANCEThe entry process of IAV represents a favorable target for drug development. In this study, we identified SLC35B4 as an important host factor for the efficient replication of different subtypes of IAV <i>in vitro</i> and for the virulence of IAV in mice. We revealed that SLC35B4 employed its UDP-xylose transport activity to promote the HS biosynthesis pathway, thereby assisting IAV internalization into target cells in the early stage of viral infection. Consistently, several downstream factors in the HS biosynthesis pathway, i.e., XYLT2, B4GALT7, EXT1, and EXT2, as well as a specific HSPG member AGRN were also important for the replication of IAV. Furthermore, the UDP-xylose-transporting activity of SLC35B4 was involved in the regulation of the homeostasis of the AGRN protein by HS modification, which influenced virus internalization by affecting the expression levels of AP2B1. Together, the identification of the SLC35B4-XYLT2-B4GALT7-EXT1-EXT2-AGRN-AP2B1 axis may shed light on the development of potential anti-IAV therapeutics.\n",

            "PRO 140, a humanized anti-HIV monoclonal antibody targeting the cell coreceptor CCR5, is currently under clinical trials, but it only affects CCR5-tropic viruses. In this study, we have engineered two tandem fusion proteins (2P23-PRO140SC and 2P23-PRO140-Fc) with bifunctional activity by adding short fusion-inhibitory peptide 2P23 to the single-chain fragment variable (scFv) of PRO 140 (PRO140SC) with or without the Fc domain of human IgG4. We first demonstrated that 2P23-PRO140SC and 2P23-PRO140-Fc could efficiently bind to the cell membranes through CCR5 anchoring, which did not affect the expression level of CCR5 on the cell surface. We then verified that the addition of 2P23 peptide to PRO140SC enabled a very potent activity against CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 isolates. As expected, the bispecific fusion proteins exhibited highly potent activities in inhibiting divergent HIV-1 subtypes and viral mutants that were resistant to the fusion inhibitors 2P23 and T20, and they displayed relatively low <i>in vitro</i> cytotoxicity. Furthermore, both the fusion proteins had robust <i>in vivo</i> anti-HIV activities in rats, with 2P23-PRO140-Fc much better than 2P23-PRO140SC. In conclusion, our studies have provided bispecific HIV-1 inhibitors that overcome the drawbacks of PRO 140 antibody and offered novel tools for studying the mechanisms of HIV-1 infection.IMPORTANCEGiven that HIV-1 evolves with high variability and drug resistance, the development of novel antivirals is important. CCR5-directed antibody PRO 140 is currently under clinical trials, but it only inhibits CCR5-tropic HIV-1 isolates. The designed fusion proteins by adding a minimum fusion-inhibitory peptide to PRO 140 enable dramatically increased activities in inhibiting both CCR5-tropic and CXCR4-tropic viruses, thus offering novel antiviral agents with a bispecific functionality that can overcome the drawbacks of PRO 140 antibody.\n",

            "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a newer class of noncoding transcripts identified as key regulators of biological processes. Here, we aimed to identify novel lncRNA targets that play critical roles in major human respiratory viral infections by systematically mining large-scale transcriptomic data sets. Using bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, we identified a previously uncharacterized lncRNA, named virus-inducible lncRNA modulator of interferon response (<i>VILMIR</i>), that was consistently upregulated after <i>in vitro</i> influenza infection across multiple human epithelial cell lines and influenza A virus subtypes. <i>VILMIR</i> was also upregulated after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections <i>in vitro</i>. We experimentally confirmed the response of <i>VILMIR</i> to influenza infection and interferon-beta (IFN-&#x3b2;) treatment in the A549 human epithelial cell line and found the expression of <i>VILMIR</i> was robustly induced by IFN-&#x3b2; treatment in a dose- and time-specific manner. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients uncovered that <i>VILMIR</i> was upregulated across various cell types, including at least five immune cells. The upregulation of <i>VILMIR</i> in immune cells was further confirmed in the human T cell and monocyte cell lines, SUP-T1 and THP-1, after IFN-&#x3b2; treatment. Finally, we found that knockdown of <i>VILMIR</i> expression reduced the magnitude of host transcriptional responses to both IFN-&#x3b2; treatment and influenza A virus infection in A549 cells. Together, our results show that <i>VILMIR</i> is a novel interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) that regulates the host interferon response and may be a potential therapeutic target for human respiratory viral infections upon further mechanistic investigation.IMPORTANCEIdentifying host factors that regulate the immune response to human respiratory viral infection is critical to developing new therapeutics. Human long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to play key regulatory roles during biological processes; however, the majority of lncRNA functions within the host antiviral response remain unknown. In this study, we identified that a previously uncharacterized lncRNA, virus-inducible lncRNA modulator of interferon response (<i>VILMIR</i>), is upregulated after major respiratory viral infections including influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and respiratory syncytial virus. We demonstrated that <i>VILMIR</i> is an interferon-stimulated gene that is upregulated after interferon-beta (IFN-&#x3b2;) in several human cell types. We also found that knockdown of <i>VILMIR</i> reduced the magnitude of host transcriptional responses to IFN-&#x3b2; treatment and influenza A infection in human epithelial cells. Our results reveal that <i>VILMIR</i> regulates the host interferon response and may present a new therapeutic target during human respiratory viral infections.\n",

            "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection induces a loss of host transcriptional activity and widespread disruption of host transcription termination, which leads to an induction of open chromatin downstream of genes. In this study, we show that lytic HSV-1 infection also leads to an extension of chromatin accessibility at promoters into downstream regions. This is most prominent for highly expressed genes and independent of the HSV-1 proteins ICP0, ICP22, ICP27, and <i>vhs</i>. ChIPmentation of the noncanonical histone variant H2A.Z, which is strongly enriched at +1 and -1 nucleosomes, indicated that these chromatin accessibility changes are linked to a downstream shift of +1 nucleosomes. In yeast, downstream shifts of +1 nucleosomes are induced by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) degradation. Accordingly, irreversible depletion of Pol II from genes in human cells using &#x3b1;-amanitin altered +1 nucleosome positioning similar to lytic HSV-1 infection. Consequently, treatment with phosphonoacetic acid and knockout of ICP4, which both prevent viral DNA replication and alleviate the loss of Pol II from host genes, largely abolished the downstream extension of accessible chromatin in HSV-1 infection. In the absence of viral genomes, doxycycline-induced expression of ICP27, which redirects Pol II from gene bodies into intergenic regions by disrupting transcription termination, induced an attenuated effect that was further enhanced by co-expression of ICP22. In summary, our study provides strong evidence that HSV-1-induced depletion of Pol II from the host genome leads to a downstream shift of +1 nucleosomes at host promoters.IMPORTANCELytic herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection leads to a profound host transcription shutoff. Loss of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in yeast has previously been shown to relax +1 nucleosome positioning to more thermodynamically favorable sites downstream of transcription start sites. Here, we show that a similar phenomenon is likely at play in lytic HSV-1 infection. Sequencing of accessible chromatin revealed a widening of nucleosome-free regions at host promoters into downstream regions. By mapping genome-wide positions of the noncanonical histone variant H2A.Z enriched at +1 and -1 nucleosomes, we demonstrate a downstream shift of +1 nucleosomes for most cellular genes in lytic HSV-1 infection. As chemical depletion of Pol II from genes also leads to a downstream shift of +1 nucleosomes in human cells, changes in chromatin architecture at promoters in HSV-1 infection are likely a consequence of HSV-1-induced loss of Pol II activity from the host genome.\n",

Rodent parechoviruses cause myocarditis, encephalitis, and perinatal death in multiple rodent species.

            "The immune response to viral infection is shaped by past exposures to related virus strains, a phenomenon known as imprinting. For severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), much of the population has been imprinted by a viral spike from an early strain, either through vaccination or infection during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a consequence of this imprinting, infection with more recent SARS-CoV-2 strains primarily boosts cross-reactive antibodies elicited by the imprinting strain. Here we compare the neutralizing antibody specificities of imprinted individuals versus infants infected with a recent strain. Specifically, we use pseudovirus-based deep mutational scanning to measure how spike mutations affect neutralization by the serum antibodies of adults and children imprinted by the original vaccine versus infants with a primary infection by an XBB* variant. While the serum neutralizing activity of the imprinted individuals primarily targets the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), the serum neutralizing activity of infants infected with only XBB* mostly targets the spike N-terminal domain. In these infants, secondary exposure to the XBB* spike via vaccination shifts more of the neutralizing activity toward the RBD, although the specific RBD sites targeted are different from imprinted adults. The dramatic differences in neutralization specificities among individuals with different exposure histories likely impact SARS-CoV-2 evolution.IMPORTANCEWe show that a person's exposure history to different SARS-CoV-2 strains strongly affects which regions on the viral spike that their neutralizing antibodies target. In particular, infants who have just been infected once with a recent viral strain make neutralizing antibodies that target different regions of the viral spike than adults or children who have been exposed to both older and more recent strains. This person-to-person heterogeneity means that the same viral mutation can have different impacts on the antibody immunity of different people.\n",

            "HIV-1 replication in macrophages is highly variable with internal virus accumulation in so-called virus-containing compartments (VCCs). VCCs represent a reservoir that is shielded from the antiviral immune response. VCC formation has been studied in lab-adapted HIV-1, but it has not been investigated whether primary HIV-1 strains induce VCCs. Furthermore, although macrophages transmit HIV-1 from VCCs to CD4+ T cells, the effect of T cells on VCCs is unknown. We analyzed the ability of primary and lab-adapted HIV-1 to replicate in macrophages, the effect of non-infected CD4+ T cell coculture, and VCC formation. All HIV-1 strains replicated in CD4+ T cells, whereas only lab-adapted HIV-1 replicated efficiently in macrophage monocultures. Coculture with non-infected CD4+ T cells enhanced the replication of primary HIV-1 in macrophages, a process associated with increased VCC formation and dependent on direct cell-to-cell contact. Broadly neutralizing antibodies differentially affected CD4+ T cell-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 replication in macrophages. CD4 antibody treatment of macrophages phenocopied the infection-promoting effect of CD4+ T cell coculture. In conclusion, non-infected CD4+ T cells facilitate primary HIV-1 replication in macrophages, and the induction of VCCs appears to be a proxy for this phenotype. VCC formation and HIV-1 replication in macrophages are promoted by non-infected CD4+ T cells in a CD4- and GP120-dependent manner. Our findings highlight the critical role of T cell-macrophage interaction in HIV-1 replication dynamics and VCC formation and call for strategies to interfere with VCCs in order to target the HIV-1 reservoir in macrophages.IMPORTANCEHere, we focus on the intimate interplay between HIV-1-infected macrophages and CD4+ T cells. Specifically, we analyzed whether primary HIV-1 strains induce virus-containing compartments (VCCs) within macrophages, which are thought to serve as viral sanctuaries and macrophage reservoirs. Notably, primary HIV-1 strains were unable to replicate in macrophages and induce VCCs unless they were cocultured with non-infected CD4+ T cells, leading to enhanced VCC formation and viral replication. This suggests an essential role for non-infected CD4+ T cells in facilitating primary HIV-1 replication in macrophages. Our data highlight the importance of not only addressing the latent HIV-1 T cell reservoir but also targeting VCC formation in macrophages to achieve the ultimate goal of functional HIV-1 cure.\n",

            "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), strongly associated with viral infections. Although the link between hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and DLBCL is well-documented, effective clinical markers reflecting HBV-associated DLBCL remain scarce. This study aims to identify prognostic indicators for HBV-associated DLBCL through retrospective analysis of the relationship among tissue marker molecules, HBV serum markers, and clinical prognosis in DLBCL patients. Here, we found the results that DLBCL patients who tested positive for hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) had significantly reduced overall survival (OS) rates compared with those who tested negative. Additionally, a strong correlation was observed between an elevated HBcAb-positive rate and reduced expression of the CD23 molecule in DLBCL tissue samples. Stratifying DLBCL patients based on combined HBcAb-CD23 status revealed significant disparities in OS rates. Therefore, integrating CD23 with HBcAb could be applied to prognostic assessments for individuals with HBV-associated DLBCL. This study identifies novel indicators and diagnostic strategies for HBV-associated DLBCL.IMPORTANCEThis study identifies hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) as a significant prognostic indicator for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The findings reveal that patients with DLBCL with positive HBcAb have significantly reduced overall survival rates. Additionally, a strong negative correlation is observed between serum HBcAb and the expression of the CD23 molecule in DLBCL tissues. These results highlight the potential of integrating HBcAb and CD23 as prognostic markers in clinical assessments of HBV-associated DLBCL, offering new insights for risk stratification and treatment planning in this patient population.\n",

            "JC Polyomavirus is the causative agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an often-fatal demyelinating disease. Unfortunately, a diagnosis of PML occurs only after patients have suffered irreversible neuropathologies. The first step in the initiation of PML is viral entry to the brain, but the route and mechanisms responsible for neuroinvasion have not been well established. To gain a better understanding of this, we asked whether purified virus or virus associated with extracellular vesicles (EVs) could penetrate two different cell culture models of the blood-brain barrier. In one model, we used the hCMEC/D3 brain endothelial cell line, and in the other, we used pluripotent stem cells induced to a brain endothelial cell phenotype (iPSC-EC). We found that neither cell type was permissive to viral infection, but the virus bound and was internalized by both in a sialic acid-dependent manner. Despite virus internalization into these cells, very few virions or virus-associated extracellular vesicles (virus-EVs) penetrated the barriers. The small amount of virus or virus-EVs that did pass through either barrier was sufficient to establish infection in human glial cells. Our findings demonstrate that limited amounts of infectious virions and virus-associated EVs can traverse the brain microvascular endothelium and establish infection.IMPORTANCEThe human polyomavirus, JC Polyomavirus (JCPyV), causes a rapidly progressing demyelinating disease in immunocompromised or immunomodulated patients. Demyelinating lesions are often seen surrounding blood vessels in the brain. In this paper, we used two models to recapitulate a minimal blood-brain barrier and found that both were highly restrictive of virus penetration. A small amount of virus succeeded in crossing both barriers and was sufficient to establish infection of human glia. These data have direct implications for mechanisms used by JCPyV to invade the CNS and cause neurological disease.\n",

            "Effective hand hygiene, such as hand washing and hand sanitizer use, is crucial in reducing infectious disease transmission via the hands. The efficacy of hand washing has been well-documented; however, relatively less is known regarding foam-based hand sanitizer efficacy, which is considered an effective alternative to washing hands with soap and water. Hand sanitizers are recommended by both the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization when the hands are not visibly dirty or greasy. This study examined the efficacy of five commercially available foam hand sanitizers-four alcohol-based and one non-alcohol-based-against enveloped and non-enveloped viruses using bacteriophage phi6 (&#x3a6;6) and bacteriophage MS2 as surrogates, respectively. A cocktail of MS2 and &#x3a6;6 (8 log PFU/mL) was inoculated on the hands and exposed to 3 or 6 mL of hand sanitizer product followed by rubbing the palmar surface of the hands together for 10 s or until dry. The results showed significant log reduction among the virus surrogates (<i>P</i> &#x2264; 0.05), with &#x3a6;6 consistently showing higher susceptibility across all factors compared with MS2 with log reductions of 2.83 &#xb1; 1.98 and 0.50 &#xb1; 0.53 log reduction, respectively. Although dosing volume did not significantly impact log reduction (<i>P</i> = 0.31), rubbing time significantly affected bacteriophage inactivation (<i>P</i> &#x2264; 0.05). Higher log reduction was observed when hands were rubbed until dry (2.69 &#xb1; 2.06), compared with the typical 10 s rubbing time (0.65 &#xb1; 0.75). This study revealed that the efficacy of commercially available foam hand sanitizers depends on rubbing time and overall product formulation, rather than exclusively on active ingredient concentration.IMPORTANCEHuman hands are a key factor in the transmission of viral diseases, and proper hand hygiene is regarded as the gold standard against the spread of such diseases. This study examined the effectiveness of a hand hygiene technique, that is, the application of foam-based hand sanitizers, against the inactivation of enveloped and non-enveloped virus surrogates on the hands. Factors such as virus type, rubbing time, volume of product used, and product formulation can significantly influence the efficacy of hand sanitizers. To assess these effects, we tested different rubbing times and product volumes across alcohol- and non-alcohol-based, foam hand sanitizer formulations, each with varying active ingredient concentrations and inactive ingredients. The study was performed on the palmar surface of human hands to realistically simulate real-world conditions, providing valuable evidence to inform future hand sanitizer practices aimed at maximizing the reduction of infectious viral pathogens on the hands.\n",

            "Control of bluetongue disease is predominantly through vaccination with licensed inactivated or live-attenuated vaccines (LAVs). Manufacturing of LAVs in endemic countries requires formulation with a high number of serotypes for effective protection. Herein, we evaluated a plasmid DNA-based reverse genetics platform for manufacturing a multivalent vaccine. The synthetic vaccine was characterized by a common BTV1 backbone, with exchange of outer capsid proteins. Recombinant South African vaccine serotypes 1, 5, and 14 were rescued by exchanging the VP2 protein on the backbone. BTV6 rescue was achieved following the exchange of VP2 and VP5 proteins. The particle sizes were comparable to commercial vaccines of respective serotypes. BTV1, BTV5, and BTV6 had distinct growth profiles compared to commercial vaccines, while BTV14 was indistinguishable. Stability and shelf-life determination under various storage conditions showed that commercial vaccines were more stable. Formulated antigens were evaluated for vaccine safety and immunogenicity in sheep. Serotyped BTV1 monovalent vaccine was safe, as no clinical signs were observed. Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were induced on day 14 and peaked at 32 on day 28. The multivalent synthetic vaccine containing four serotypes elicited BTV6 nAbs from day 21 with a titer of 52, which decreased to 33 by day 42. BTV1 elicited a weak immune response with a titer of 1 on day 42. No nAbs were detected against BTV5 and BTV14. This is a first report comparing reverse genetics-derived antigens with commercial vaccines. Data generated on production yields, stability, and immunogenicity demonstrated that some serotypes can be implemented as novel synthetic vaccines using this platform.IMPORTANCEVaccination is the most effective control strategy for viral diseases that affect livestock. To date, only live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines have been licensed for control of bluetongue (BT). This study demonstrated the use of reverse genetics as a possible platform for BTV vaccine production. Data generated in the study contribute toward the advancement of an alternative manufacturing platform for licensing of BT vaccines. Information on production yields and stability of synthetic vaccines in comparison to the conventional products demonstrated that optimization is required for some serotypes to fully translate the reverse genetics platform for manufacturing the BTV vaccine. The study highlighted the safety and immunogenicity of vaccines manufactured using the plasmid DNA-based reverse-genetics platform.\n",

Among these patients, we identified seven cases of myocarditis, one case of acute anterior myocardial infarction due to coronary aneurysms secondary to Kawasaki disease, one case of severe anemia with pancytopenia, two cases of encephalitis, one case of septic shock with meningitis, and one case of septic shock with pancreatitis. Four children required ECMO treatment. One patient succumbed to cardiac shock, while two patients were assisted by the Berlin Heart Support System and remain on the transplant list. After discharge, all patients required ongoing medical assistance, including follow-up care or therapy. This report underscores the importance of prioritizing proactive surveillance by health professionals, focusing not only on monitoring emerging pathogens but also on those that may reemerge with increased aggressiveness in the epidemiological landscape. Additionally, it highlights the need to reassess the risk of severe PVB19 infections in healthy populations.\n",

            "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a worldwide health problem. Both CD4+ and CD8&#x2009;+&#x2009;T cells play crucial roles in HBV clearance from acute patients. Nevertheless, an extrathymic CD4 and CD8 double positive T (DPT) cell subset have been reported earlier, the function of these cells in HBV infection is still poorly understood. Herein, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from hepatitis B patients. HBV model mice were established via hydrodynamic injection (HDI) of pAAV-HBV1.2 plasmid. T cells subsets were analyzed with flow cytometry. We found that in acute HBV infection extrathymic DPT cells were significantly increased in acute patients and HDI-based HBV model mice. Unlike thymic DPT cells, these extrathymic DPT cells activated with a CD44&#x2009;+&#x2009;CD62L+ central memory phenotype. Furthermore, in vitro cultured DPT cells showed the capability to rapidly proliferate and produce multi cytokines after stimulation with HBV peptides. The performance of adoptive transfer depicted that DPT cells were able to migrate into the liver. Immunohistochemistry data from liver biopsies of patients showed that DPT cells were more prone to detection in acute tissue. Purified DPT cells could efficiently kill HBV peptide-loaded hepatocytes in a cytotoxicity assay, and the frequency of DPT cells were reversely correlated with HBV clearance in model mice. Importantly, the transferred DPT cells accelerated the clearance of HBV in mice. Collectively, our study revealed that extrathymic DPT cells are an important immune subset, contributing to viral clearance during HBV infection, which may benefit cure of chronic hepatitis B.\n",

It describes trends in respiratory viruses, related symptoms, and participant demographics and behaviors. VMD used self-swabbing and self-reported symptoms to monitor respiratory viruses in the general population. Participants were recruited via digital invitations to a representative sample of the population or through workplaces. Symptomatic participants could self-swab and register their samples and report their symptoms via a dedicated smartphone web app. With 30&#x2009;627 participants and 12&#x2009;642 samples analyzed, VMD had a broad demographic representation. SARS-CoV-2 was the most frequently detected virus, with positivity rates peaking at over 50% in late 2023. Participants commonly self-swabbed because of fever, cough, and rhinorrhea, with influenza A linked to the highest median number of symptoms. Participants only provided samples after reaching a specific symptom threshold, and participation affected the health-seeking behaviors and work attendance of a few individuals. VMD continuously provided real-time insights into respiratory virus trends and symptomatology in the general non-healthcare-seeking population. Its accessibility - available to anyone with a Danish identification number, a smartphone, and an invitation - highlights its potential as a pandemic preparedness tool.\n",

            "The epidemiology of parechovirus-A3 (PeV-A3) infection in neonates and young infants changed during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We hypothesized the pandemic impacted maternal antibodies against PeV-A3. To test this hypothesis, we measured neutralizing antibody titers (NATs) against PeV-A3 in 102 cord blood samples from full-term infants born in June-December 2023 at Niigata University Hospital in Niigata, Japan. Maternal data were collected and compared the findings with our previous pre-pandemic data. The median maternal age was 34.5&#x2009;years (range: 30-37 years). The geometric mean titer (GMT) against PeV-A3 was 98.4 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 61.7-156.8). The GMT for ages 25-34 years (184.6, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;45) and 35-44 years (56.3, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;51) sustained at the same level when we compared to age-matched pre-pandemic data for ages 16-24 years (336.5, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.84) and 25-34 years (31.9, n&#x2009;=&#x2009;107, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.14), respectively. By multivariable logistic regression analyses, maternal age &#x2264;&#x2009;34&#x2009;years was associated with higher seropositivity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.12, 95% CI 1.18-8.78, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03). Maternal NATs against PeV-A3 were sustained at the same level during the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating intra-pandemic maintenance of humoral immunity to PeV-A3 in women of childbearing age.\n",

These are an ability to take the initiative, a sense of curiosity, a broad perspective on health threats, a recognition that there are those who are opposed to health, a willingness to speak truth to power, confidence, and the ability to engage with leaders in other sectors, a commitment to values, and an ability to communicate.

            "H13 and H16 subtype avian influenza viruses (AIVs) typically infect <i>Charadriiformes</i>, are widely distributed throughout coastal regions worldwide, and pose a risk of spill-over to mammals. Systematic research on the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and biological characteristics of these subtypes remains limited. To address this gap, we analyzed 20 years of wild bird influenza surveillance data from China integrated with global influenza database information to reconstruct the global spatiotemporal distribution, transmission dynamics and public health implications of H13 and H16. During influenza surveillance, 28 H13 and 19 H16 viruses were isolated. The phylogenetic trees for the H13 and H16 viruses revealed that both subtypes could be classified into three distinct groups. Viruses from H13 Group A, H13 Group C, and H16 Group C demonstrated frequent genetic exchanges and intercontinental transmission on a global scale. Mapping host migration revealed overlap between virus spread and host migration pathways. Our results suggest that host migration is a key driver of widespread distribution, cross-regional spread, and gene exchange for some H13 and H16 lineages. Virus isolates exhibit high genetic diversity with rich genotypic variation. Most isolates carry mammalian-adaptive mutations, such as the G228S mutation in the HA protein. H13 and H16 isolates of multiple genotypes infected mice without prior adaptation and exhibited varying tissue tropism. In summary, these findings indicate that host migration patterns are closely associated with the evolution of H13 and H16 AIVs. The potential risk of mammalian infection is highlighted, as viruses carrying mammalian-adaptive mutations may lead to new infection cases.\n",

            "The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of the age of the breeder flock of commercial BUT - 6 turkeys on the transfer of maternal antibodies to chicks. The blood samples for serological analysis were collected from randomly selected 63 female breeders from a flock of BUT Big 6 turkeys and 63 one-day-old hybrid turkey poults hatched from eggs from this flock at 36, 45 and 54 week of age. During blood analysis (serum) in the laboratory, the level of antibodies of the breeder flock against Avian metapneumoviruses (APV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and Hemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV) was determined (ELISA). Maternal antibody (MatAb) titer in chicks (serum) against the same viruses were also determined. The percentage (%) transfer of MatAb to offspring was then evaluated. The effect of the age of the turkeys on the antibody titer to the tested pathogens expressed in geometric mean titers (GMT) was shown. During the laying period, the antibody titer of the tested turkeys against NDV decreased with the age of the flock. The highest antibody titer was demonstrated in week 36 (GMT=14242), whereas the lowest was in week 54 (GMT=5564). In contrast, the serum antibody titer of the tested layers against APV and HEV increased with the age of the birds. The lowest antibody titer (GMTAPV=24818; GMTHEV=12070) was observed at the beginning of the laying period, and the highest at the end of the laying period (GMTAPV =38978; GMTHEV =13980). The highest vertical transfer to offspring was shown for antibodies to - HEV (82.7%), while the lowest was shown when analyzing sera to - NDV (37.6%). The present analysis showed significant differences in the evaluated antibody titres in serum of turkey breeders during the laying period, as well as in the level of MatAb in chicks. The results also indicate that the transfer of MatAb to chicks is influenced by the age of the parent flock and the type of pathogen against which the layers were vaccinated.\n",

The relationship between 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase like (OASL), interferon alpha (IFN-&#x3b1;), and duck hepatitis A virus type 3 (DHAV-3) virus genome copy number in duck embryo tissues was studied to investigate duck's natural antiviral immunity mechanism. 15-day-old SPF duck embryos were infected with DHAV-3 and their organs and tissues were collected at various times after inoculation. RT real-time PCR was used to determine OASL and IFNA mRNA expression levels and the DHAV-3 copy number. Compared with that at 0 hours, liver OASL transcription increased significantly at 24 hours, and extremely significantly in the liver, heart, gizzard, small intestine, and muscle at 48 hours. The heart had the highest expression level, followed by the liver, with lower expression in the other tissues. There was no significant difference in IFNA expression between the heart and liver at 12 hours, but it started to rise at 24 hours, reaching its maximum at 48 hours. Although IFNA expression increased in the gizzards, small intestines, and muscles, its relative expression levels were lower than those in the heart and liver. In the tissues, the virus genome copy number peaked at 24 hours, and then decreased. The liver had the highest virus genome copy number, followed by the heart. The results implied that the differences in OASL transcription in the tested tissues were similar to those of IFNA. Thus, the immune response (OASL and IFN-&#x3b1; levels) of duck embryos to DHAV-3 shows tissue differences, especially in the liver and heart.\n",

            "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV). It leads to reproductive disorders and respiratory failure in sows and piglets. As an endoribonuclease, the PRRSV non-structural protein 11 (NSP11) is crucial in replication and assists immune system evasion. NSP11, which is relatively more conserved than NSP2, could potentially cause a new round of PRRSV epidemics, given a major mutation occurs. Here, we aimed to analyze the PRRSV-2 NSP11 genetic diversity in China between 1996-2022. The NSP11 nucleotide sequence was analyzed in 60 PRRSV-2 strains, revealing a similarity of 83.6% - 100%. Similarly, amino acid sequences exhibited homology ranges of 91.0% - 100.0%. Amino acid sequence alignment analysis revealed multiple substitutions in NSP11. NSP11 phylogenetic analysis of 489 PRRSV-2 strains revealed that Lineages 8 and 1 were the predominant strains of PRRSV circulating in China. These two lineages exhibit relatively close genetic relationships. Although unsupported by SimPlot analysis, recombination analysis suggested a potential recombination event in the 489 PRRSV-2 NSP11 sequences. Recombination analysis and amino acid sequence alignment confirmed the PRRSV NSP11 conservation. Our findings provide genetic diversity of PRRSV-2 NSP11 in China and contribute to effective strategy development to prevent and control PRRSV.\n",

However, C57BL/6 mice, compared to BALB/c mice, seem less susceptible to MPXV, evidenced by no significant weight loss, lower viral load, faster viral clearance, and earlier pathological improvement, as well as weaker antibody response. Interestingly, C57BL/6 <i>stat1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice intranasally infected with MPXV displayed a significant body weight loss, indicating the crucial role of innate immunity in the susceptibility to MPXV.

In this study, the adhesion-blocking dispirotripiperazine core compound PDSTP was evaluated against SARS-CoV-2 <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. We demonstrated that the molecule was acceptably active against two clinical isolates affecting the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2&#x202f;cycle.

            "When the Asian tiger mosquito (<i>Aedes albopictus</i>) was discovered in the EU for the first time, in a kindergarten in Genua (Italy) in 1990, it was followed initially by a call for action to stop its spread, but gradually turned into a 'study object', resulting in hundreds of research papers since, but very little action in terms of actually trying to eliminate it. Europe is now facing the grave consequences of this lack of action, with dengue, Chikungunya, and West Nile virus already creating problems around the Mediterranean, and aided by climate change both the mosquito and these diseases will move farther north in years to come, posing a risk to millions of people. This history is now repeating itself in the Horn of Africa. It's been thirteen years since <i>Anopheles stephensi</i>, an Asian malaria vector, invaded Djibouti, and has not had much going against it since. And like in Europe, <i>stephensi</i> has become 'the new kid on the block' for academics, and paper after paper (87 in the last 3 years) is coming online, always calling for action in the final paragraphs, but forgetting that mosquitoes don't care about papers and happily continue to conquer more terrain as we sit down to read another paper. Research should focus exclusively on four things: where is the mosquito (surveillance), what works to kill it (control), how do we free areas of it (implementation strategy) and how can we prevent re-invasion of cleared areas. In two of these areas we're almost clueless: strategic area-wide vector elimination and preventing re-invasion. Action in these areas is therefore critical if Africa is to prevent repeating Europe's mistake. And should start with garnering unwavering support and resources from governments of affected countries, regional organisations, and global players. The <i>stephensi</i> problem will not be solved with a dipper searching for larvae in the field. It should start by knocking on politicians' doors, intense lobbying, and succeeding in having the problem addressed with utmost priority. Only then will the means and resources become available to attempt elimination of this invasive vector. Critically, these resources should not affect any ongoing malaria control efforts but should be freed specifically for this purpose. On a more positive note, going aggressively after <i>stephensi</i> would concurrently teach us ways to go after indigenous African vectors in an area-wide fashion, notably through larval source management. Inertia will merely push us all decades backwards in terms of hoping to eliminate malaria in Africa one day.\n",

            "Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) is one of the neglected tick-borne viral zoonoses. KFD virus (KFDV) was initially considered endemic to the Western Ghats region of Karnataka state in India. Over the years, there have been reports of its spread to newer areas within and outside Karnataka. The absence of an effective treatment for KFD mandates the need for further research and development of novel vaccines. The present study was designed to develop a multi-epitope vaccine candidate against KFDV using immunoinformatics approaches. A total of 74 complete KFDV genome sequences were analysed for genetic recombination followed by phylogeny. Computational prediction of B- and T-cell epitopes belonging to envelope protein was performed and epitopes were prioritised based on IFN-Gamma, IL-4, IL-10 stimulation and checked for allergenicity and toxicity. The eight short-listed epitopes (three MHC-Class 1, three MHC-Class 2 and two B-cell) were then combined using various linkers to construct the vaccine candidate. Molecular docking followed by molecular simulations revealed stable interactions of the vaccine candidate with immune receptor complex namely Toll-like receptors (TLR2-TLR6). Codon optimization followed by <i>in-silico</i> cloning of the designed multi-epitope vaccine construct into the pET30b (+) expression vector was carried out. Immunoinformatics analysis of the multi-epitope vaccine candidate in the current study has potential to significantly accelerate the initial stages of vaccine development. Experimental validation of the potential multi-epitope vaccine candidate remains crucial to confirm effectiveness and safety in real-world conditions.\n",

            "Palmoplantar Pustulosis (PPP) is a rare chronic skin disorder characterized by recurrent sterile pustules on palms and soles, leading to significant pain and functional impairment. Treatments include topical medications, phototherapy, systemic treatments, and biologics, but nonconclusive strategy exists. Here we report a case of a 66-year-old Chinese woman who developed refractory PPP after COVID-19 vaccination, characterized by painful, itchy pustules on her hands and feet. Initial treatments such as topical corticosteroids, calcipotriol, methotrexate, and cyclosporine were ineffective. Due to potential hypersensitivity reactions post-vaccination and elevated Immunoglobulin (Ig)E levels, anti-IgE therapy was administrated. Omalizumab treatment resulted some improvement, but noticeable symptoms persisted. Upon switching to upadacitinib, the patient experienced rapid and complete resolution of pustules and desquamation, with continued symptom control and no severe adverse reactions over a year. Throughout the treatment, clinical symptoms and the patient's quality of life were assessed using the Palmoplantar Pustular Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PPP ASI), the Palmoplantar Pustulosis Physician Global Assessment (PPP PGA), and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Serum IgE and food-specific (FS)-IgG4 levels were monitored. Additionally, reductions in cytokine levels (interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, IL-25, IL-33, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x3b1;) were observed after upadacitinib treatment. This case highlights the potential of upadacitinib, as an effective treatment for PPP, emphasizing the need for further research into targeted therapies addressing multiple signaling pathways involved in PPP's pathogenesis.\n",

            "<i>In&#xa0;vivo</i> gene therapy targeting hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) holds significant therapeutic potential for treating hematological diseases. This study uses adeno-associated virus serotype 6 (AAV6) vectors and Cre recombination to systematically optimize the parameters for effective <i>in&#xa0;vivo</i> HSC transduction. We evaluated various genetic architectures and delivery methods of AAV6, establishing an optimized protocol that achieved functional recombination in more than two-thirds of immunophenotypic HSCs. Our findings highlight that second-strand synthesis is a critical limiting factor for transgene expression in HSCs, leading to significant under-detection of HSC transduction with single-stranded AAV6 vectors. We also demonstrate that HSCs in the bone marrow (BM) are readily accessible to transduction, with neither localized injection nor mobilization of HSCs into the bloodstream, enhancing transduction efficacy. Additionally, we observed a surprising preference for HSC transduction over other BM cells, regardless of the AAV6 delivery route. Together, these findings not only underscore the potential of AAV vectors for <i>in&#xa0;vivo</i> HSC gene therapy but also lay a foundation that can inform the development of both <i>in&#xa0;vivo</i> AAV-based HSC gene therapies and potentially <i>in&#xa0;vivo</i> HSC gene therapies that employ alternative delivery modalities.\n",

            "Tzanck smears, first introduced by Arnault Tzanck, are widely used in dermatology for the cytodiagnosis of cutaneous lesions. In the current era of evidence-based medicine with the availability of more confirmatory sophisticated tests, the use of this bedside tool is limited. In this article, the authors tried to assess the utility of Tzanck smear in various dermatological disorders. Findings in the Pemphigus group of disorders were studied in detail with complete and incomplete changes. Results were compared with histopathology, anti-desmoglein antibody status, and in combination. Further subtle features of the acantholytic cells were studied in detail. The sensitivity and specificity with histopathology and anti-desmoglein antibodies were 80.70%, 68.18% and 82.75%,100%. When patients were having either follow-up of histopathology or anti-desmoglein antibodies, each sensitivity was 81.01% and specificity was 87.50%. Complete acantholytic cells were predominant in 39.18%, and incomplete cells were predominant in 60.32% of cases. Rounding was the most consistent feature followed by nuclear enlargement. Streptocytes, dyskeratosis, and tadpole cells were also seen in a few cases. Other diagnoses of viral infections, like molluscum contagiosum (4 cases) and Herpes virus cytopathic effects (25 cases), were also observed in the study. Finally, Tzanck smear is still useful in dermatology, which can aid in rapid diagnosis and starting early treatment. Incomplete acantholytic cells, when seen in smear, help to pick up Pemphigus disorders even if all the classical features are not seen.\n",

            "BackgroundDue to high-risk sexual networks along their transit routes, Long-distance truckers' (LDTs) risk of HIV is known to be high, as evidenced by prevalence rates of 14.34% in the region. Besides, the spaces in which LDTs operate are often marred with a multitude of barriers to HIV/AIDS risk reduction. However, there is limited evidence on the barriers encountered by LDTs in Kenya, hence the need for the current study.Methods and MethodologyWe used nine key informants and 18 in-depth interviews from purposively sampled participants, such as nurses and LDT peer educators at Kenya's Busia and Namanga international border points. We used semi-structured interview guides to collect data through audio records. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and thematically analysed using the QDA-Miner software to generate themes and sub-themes around barriers to HIV/AIDS risk reduction among LDTs.FindingsOverall, three themes, namely, health system, individual-level, and trucking career-related barriers emerged. The sub-themes under health system barriers included the location of healthcare facilities far from transit routes, long durations of hospital waiting time, and lack of targeted health facilities for LDTs, among several others. Under trucking career-related barriers, the sub-themes comprised tight work schedules, unfavourable trucking career policies, and insecurity along transit routes. For individual barriers, some of the sub-themes were language barriers and lack of awareness of current HIV/AIDS risk reduction services.ConclusionAlongside health system factors, individual level and trucking career-related factors were highlighted as the barriers to HIV/AIDS risk reduction among LDTs in Kenya. The existence of these barriers may complicate the fight against the pandemic in this hard-to-reach population, given their already known vulnerability to HIV infections.\n",

The patient initially presented with left-sided hemiplegia and loss of consciousness. Initial diagnostic tests could not identify the cause of the encephalomyelitis, leading to a preliminary diagnosis of autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Despite treatment with corticosteroids and plasma exchange, the patient experienced status epilepticus, which required multiple antiseizure medications. TBE viral antibodies were eventually detected, confirming the diagnosis. Despite the treatment, the patient remained critically ill.

            "First reported by Kussmaul in 1879, sialodochitis fibrinosa is a disease of the parotid and/or submandibular glands that is characterized by pain and diffuse swelling. It is believed to be caused by obstruction of the salivary duct by mucofibrinous plugs and is often misdiagnosed as other types of sialadenitis, such as Sj&#xf6;gren' s syndrome, or sialadenitis caused by bacterial or viral infection. Although specific diagnostic criteria have not been defined, the typical pathological finding of sialodochitis fibrinosa is infiltration of lymphocytes and eosinophils into the interstitium around the salivary ducts. Sialendoscopy, a minimally invasive endoscopic technique, has recently been used to diagnose and treat diseases of the salivary glands. This new technique can be used to irrigate and dilate the salivary gland ducts under direct vision. We successfully used sialendoscopy to diagnose and treat sialodochitis fibrinosa, making this the first reported use of this technique for salivary gland biopsies. Sialendoscopy is a modern approach to salivary gland disorders that was helpful for understanding, diagnosing, and managing sialodochitis fibrinosa.\n",

            "Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) induces wasting and immunosuppression in pigs and is widely transmitted in pig farms worldwide. Classical swine fever (CSF) is a particularly important contagious disease in pigs. In CSF-endemic areas, such as Japan, thorough vaccination is performed, and effective use of the CSF vaccine is important to prevent outbreaks. This study investigated the impact of PCV2 infection on the immune response to CSF vaccines in field farms. The mortality rate of fattening pigs on the farm was investigated, and pig sera were used to measure the PCV2 viral load and neutralizing antibody titer of CSF as indicators of CSF vaccine efficacy. Results indicated a sharp increase in mortality rate, PCV2 detection rate reaching 100%, and high viral load, whereas CSF antibody titers were significantly lower in the fattening pig herd. After PCV2 inactivated vaccination was initiated, the mortality rate, PCV2 detection rate, and viral load in fattening pigs decreased, and CSF antibody titers also improved. Furthermore, there was a correlation between higher PCV2 viral load and lower CSF antibody titers in this farm. In contrast, other PCV2-vaccinated farms had higher CSF antibody levels. These results indicate that PCV2 infection negatively affects the efficacy of CSF vaccines, and the control of PCV2 in field farms is important.\n",

Host restriction factors constitute a vital defensive barrier against viral infections, typically interacting with viruses at specific stages of their replication process to disrupt it. Considering that traditional PEDV vaccines often struggle to effectively activate mucosal immunity in sows and thereby fail to provide reliable passive immunity to piglets via milk, this review focuses on the host restriction factors that play crucial roles in restricting PEDV infection and replication.

            "Dengue Virus (DENV) is a life-threatening pathogen leading to dengue fever, which brings about huge public health challenges globally. However, traditional detection methods currently fail to meet the increasing demands of clinic practice in terms of speed, simplicity, and accuracy. To address these limitations, we developed a novel, rapid, and highly sensitive diagnostic method for universal DENV detection by integrating recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay and the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR) and associated (Cas) protein 12a (CRISPR/Cas12a) system into one-pot. This approach achieves exceptional sensitivity and specificity for DENV detection, with the entire process completed within 40&#xa0;min, without the need for sophisticated equipment. The limit of detection (LOD) was determined to be 91.7 copies/test. Using this one-pot RT-RPA CRISPR/Cas12a detection system, all four serotypes of DENV (1 to 4) were successfully identified. In terms of specificity, the assay accurately detected DENV-infected positive samples without cross-reactivity with four other interfering viruses-infected samples (VSV, SeV, HSV-1 and IAV). Furthermore, we established a universal DENV RT-RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a-lateral flow dipstick (LFD) platform, which successfully identified all four serotypes of DENV with a sensitivity of approximately 250 copies/test. Collectively, our method not only provides a robust alternative for universal DENV detection but also offers valuable insights for the identification of other viruses.\n",

            "The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacts with ACE2, a key receptor within the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays a critical role in maintaining vascular homeostasis, regulating blood pressure, and modulating inflammation. An observational study analyzed the gene expression profiles of RAAS receptors and associated miRNAs in 88 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 20 healthy controls, comparing the acute and post-acute phases to assess their impact on disease severity and recovery. Our findings revealed an association between reduced MAS1 expression in both advanced age (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03) and the need for oxygen supplementation (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04). Additionally, reduced ACE expression was associated with worse mortality outcomes (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). Notably, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was significantly decreased (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) in individuals requiring oxygen supplementation and in those with diabetes mellitus during both the acute and post-COVID-19 phases, further highlighting the impact of these conditions on RAAS. The miRNA analysis revealed significant downregulation of miR-200c (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005), miR-let-7 (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01), and miR-122 (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03) in acute-phase COVID-19 patients. This dysregulation contributes to the inflammatory response and highlights the interaction between viral entry and immune regulation. These results underscore the significance of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MAS1 axis in inflammation regulation and suggest that targeting this pathway may have therapeutic potential. Our study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis and identifies the modulation of RAAS receptors and miRNAs as promising biomarkers for disease severity and potential therapeutic interventions.

This study aimed to discover the correlation of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants recorded by Nextstrain clade and PANGO lineage and the number of new confirmed cases. Percent stacked area charts were utilized to display their development trends. 31 and 1452 variants were named according to Nextstrain clade and PANGO lineage, respectively. The branch step value maintained a stable increase by linear regression analysis. The changing trend in SARS-CoV-2 variants (PANGO lineage) correlated negatively with the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases through Spearman rank correlation coefficient (17/06/2020-17/11/2021, &#x3c1;=-0.387, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01; 15/12/2021-11/01/2023, &#x3c1;=-0.458, P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). The proportion and composition of dominant virus variants had regional discrepancies, but some also fluctuated. The speed and quantity of SARS-CoV-2 variants objectively reflect the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic and viral dissemination in the population even without valuable data of reported new confirmed cases. The SARS-CoV-2 variation may be a better tool for epidemic monitoring and early-warning in the low epidemic state.\n",

CHPV paediatric encephalitis reported in 2003-2004 in central and south-western parts of India had a case fatality rate of &#x223c;70%. CHPV infection leads to high-grade fever, vomiting, altered sensorium, generalised convulsions, decerebrate posture and coma. Neuroinflammation is the hallmark of CHPV infection and has a pronounced effect on cerebral and brainstem regions. Currently, there are no vaccines or treatments available for CHPV infection. Although previous studies have provided insights into the virus's pathology and host-pathogen interactions, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying CHPV pathogenesis are poorly understood. Understanding molecular pathogenesis is crucial for developing efficacious therapies and preventive measures.

            "Viral infections are major contributors to crop yield loss and represent a significant threat to sustainable agriculture. Plants respond to virus attacks by activating sophisticated signalling cascades that initiate multiple defence mechanisms. Notably, several phytohormones, including salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), abscisic acid (ABA), and ethylene (ET), are known to shape these defence responses. In recent years, various plant growth regulators (PGRs) such as melatonin, carrageenans, sulfated fucan oligosaccharides, nitric oxide (NO), brassinosteroids (BRs), and hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) have also emerged as crucial regulators of plant defence responses against virus infections. Emerging evidence indicates that these PGRs coordinate with phytohormones to activate various defence strategies, including (1) stomatal closure to limit pathogen entry, (2) callose deposition to block plasmodesmata and restrict viral spread within host tissues, (3) attenuation of viral replication, and (4) activation of RNA interference (RNAi), a crucial antiviral defence response. However, the interactions and crosstalk between PGRs and phytohormones remain largely underexplored, thereby limiting our ability to develop innovative strategies for managing viral diseases. This review discusses the diverse functions and crosstalk among various phytohormones and PGRs in orchestrating the plant defence mechanisms, highlighting their impact on viral replication, movement, and intercellular transport.\n",

A single-blind, randomized, comparative experimental study was conducted on nine HIV-negative classical KS patients at Kocaeli University Dermatology Outpatient Clinic between April 2022 and April 2023. Each patient received both CT and PYL treatments on separate lesions. Lesions were scored based on surface area and depth before and after treatment, and percentage change (PC) was calculated. A total of 41 lesions were treated (16 with CT and 25 with PYL). CT achieved 100% median PC, while PYL showed a median PC of 42.58% (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008). No significant difference was observed between CT and PYL in macule/patch lesions (DS-1, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.192), but CT was significantly more effective for papule/plaque lesions (DS-2, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.048). CT caused minor side effects such as blistering and delayed healing, while PYL was well-tolerated with no adverse events. PYL demonstrated comparable efficacy to CT for early-stage KS lesions with fewer complications, making it a promising alternative for patients unable to tolerate CT. However, CT remains more effective for advanced lesions. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings in larger cohorts.\n",

            "Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a significant public health concern, particularly during pregnancy. The impact of HPV infection during pregnancy on maternal and child health is a growing concern. However, research on infection rate and pregnancy outcomes of nine-valent vaccine-covered and non-covered high-risk HPV subtypes during pregnancy remains limited. A retrospective cohort study involved 7110 pregnant women who underwent HPV testing in Fujian Provincial Maternity and Child Health Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University (FMCH) from January 2021 to December 2022. Multiple logistic regression analyses investigated the association between HPV infections and maternal and neonatal outcomes. The study identified that the overall HPV infection rate in pregnant women was 19.9%. The HPV types 52, 16, 58, 42, and 51 were the most common among the participants. Infections with nine-valent HPV vaccine-covered high-risk subtypes significantly increased the risk of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.29; 95% CI: 1.08-1.55) and cesarean section (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.25; 95% CI: 1.06-1.49). Co-infections with both nine-valent vaccine-covered and non-covered high-risk HPV subtypes elevated the risks of cesarean section (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.59; 95% CI: 1.11-2.27) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.73; 95% CI: 1.44-5.15). Additionally, these infections significantly increased the risk of small for gestational age (SGA) infants, with the group IV (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.07; 95% CI: 1.21-3.54) having a higher risk than the group III (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.33; 95% CI: 0.17-1.65). Moreover, those neonates who were born to mothers with HPV co-infections had a significantly higher risk of ICU admission (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.58; 95% CI: 1.01-2.49). This study revealed the significant association between specific HPV infections during pregnancy and adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. These findings underscore the importance of monitoring HPV infections during pregnancy and suggest that an enhanced rate of the nine-valent HPV vaccine and strengthen the development and application of the non-nine-valent HPV vaccine could improve maternal-fetal health outcomes.\n",

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) EV nucleic acid detection was performed on 1520 children with positive EV nucleic acid throat swabs or stool samples showing clinical manifestations of viral encephalitis; a total of 140 positive cases (9.21%) were detected, including CV-A16 2.14% (3/140), CV-A10 1.43% (2/140), CV-A6 9.29% (13/140), EV-A71 0%(0/140), and other uncategorized EVs 87.14% (122/140). Among the 140 cerebrospinal fluid EV-positive children, 32 had typical hand-foot-mouth disease or herpetic angina, and 108 had only fever and upper respiratory tract infection. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR detection and virus typing can greatly improve the diagnosis rate of EV. Multi-sample EV nucleic acid detection and virus typing in children with viral encephalitis effectively improve the etiological diagnosis rate. Nonetheless, the development of multivalent vaccines remains the most economical and effective measure to prevent and control EV infection.\n",

            "The Mediator complex facilitates interactions between transcription factors and RNA polymerase II, a process that is required for host gene transcription, including in response to viral infections. Among the many subunits in the Mediator complex, the MED25 subunit has been shown to be a target for viral activators during infection. Here we provide the molecular basis for the interaction between human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) nonstructural 1 protein (NS1) and the activator interaction domain (ACID) of MED25. The X-ray crystal structure of the complex revealed that NS1 straddles and binds two faces of MED25 ACID. This interaction is distinct from previously known viral activators. Importantly, our data support the conformational flexibility of viral transcriptional regulators. Furthermore, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis identified the ATF3 transcription factor and a role for NS1/Mediator/ATF3 interaction in host gene regulation in hRSV infections. Our findings provide a molecular basis for hRSV NS1-based regulation of host gene transcription and reveal how viruses exploit the conformational heterogeneity at fuzzy transcription activator interfaces.\n",

            "The World Health Organization's designation of mpox as a public health emergency of international concern in August 2024 underscores the urgent need for effective diagnostic solutions to combat this escalating threat. The rapid global spread of clade II mpox, coupled with the sustained human-to-human transmission of the more virulent clade I mpox in the Democratic Republic of Congo, highlights a critical gap in point-of-care diagnostics for this emergent disease. In response, we developed Dragonfly, a portable molecular diagnostic platform for point-of-care use that integrates power-free nucleic acid extraction (&lt;5&#x2009;minutes) with lyophilised colourimetric LAMP chemistry. The platform demonstrated an analytical limit-of-detection of 100 genome copies per reaction for monkeypox virus, effectively distinguishing it from other orthopoxviruses, herpes simplex virus, and varicella-zoster virus. Clinical validation on 164 samples, including 51 mpox-positive cases, yielded 96.1% sensitivity and 100% specificity for orthopoxviruses, and 94.1% sensitivity and 100% specificity for monkeypox virus. Here, we present a rapid, accessible, and robust point-of-care diagnostic solution for mpox, suitable for both low- and high-resource settings, addressing the global resurgence of orthopoxviruses in the context of declining smallpox immunity.\n",

            "The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a significant increase in the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This retrospective study aims to compare the differences in demographic, clinical, and biochemical variables and predictive factors in 2 situations of ARDS cause (COVID-19 vs NON-COVID-19) in patients admitted to the intensive care unit. The Mann-Whitney rank-sum test was performed for quantitative variables, and Fisher exact test for qualitative variables. 115 patients with ARDS were enrolled (53 patients with COVID-19 ARDS and 62 NON-COVID-19 ARDS). The COVID-19 ARDS group consisted of 33 male patients (66.2%), whereas the NON-COVID-19 ARDS group had 25 male patients (40.3%) (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.0248). The median and interquartile age difference of the COVID-19 ARDS group was 64.0 [52.0-69.5], and non-COVID-19 ARDS was 49.0 [34.0-63.0] (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.0011). Body mass index, simplified acute physiology score, sequential organ failure assessment, and intensive care unit length of stay, with P-values of .0061, .0002, .0003, and &lt;.0001, respectively (COVID-19 vs NON-COVID-19 ARDS). Diabetes, arterial hypertension, venous thrombosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had values of &lt;.0001, .0234, .0358, and .0001, respectively. On the other hand, the NON-COVID-19 ARDS group had a greater need for dialysis (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.0109). The stepwise logistic regression showed that relevant clinical, and demographic characteristics associated with ARDS due to COVID-19, such as male gender, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and body mass index, were independent prognostic factors of severity in patients with COVID-19 ARDS, compared to NON-COVID-19 ARDS. The overall mortality rate was 62.9% for COVID-19 ARDS and 77.4% for the non-COVID-19 ARDS group (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.2950). Ventilatory parameters of COVID-19 ARDS and NON-COVID-19 ARDS were similar.\n",

            "Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disorder characterized by congenital malformations, bone marrow failure, and malignancies. Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is the only proven cure for the hematological complications. FA patients have increased chromosomal instability and aberrant deoxyribonucleic acid repair and thus can only tolerate low doses of chemotherapy or radiation as part of conditioning prior to HCT. Yet, they are still prone to severe regimen related toxicities including hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) from cyclophosphamide (CY). As CYP2B6 is a primary enzyme responsible for the catalyzation of the prodrug form of CY, understanding the association between CYP2B6 genetic variants and HC in FA patients may predict which patients will be more susceptible to developing HC. A descriptive genetic association study was performed to identify genetic variants associated with HC in patients with FA who underwent HCT between 1999 and 2017. All patients received a CY-based preparative regimen and had pretransplant recipient deoxyribonucleic acid available for genomic analysis. Forty FA pediatric patients were eligible for this analysis. They had received HCT from matched sibling donors (n&#x2005;=&#x2005;6) or alternative donors (n&#x2005;=&#x2005;34) for marrow failure (n&#x2005;=&#x2005;38) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n&#x2005;=&#x2005;2). The incidence of HC was 32.5% which occurred at a median of 32 days (range 20-180) after HCT. 9 patients had a concomitant viral infection (BK virus, n&#x2005;=&#x2005;8 both adenovirus and BK virus, n&#x2005;=&#x2005;1). No genetic variants were significantly associated with HC. The top variants were rs2279343 (g.23060A&#x2005;&gt;&#x2005;G), and rs2279344 (g.23280G&#x2005;&gt;&#x2005;A) in the CYP2B6 gene. The incidence of HC among FA patients with the rs2279343 variant was 42% (CI 22%-62%) compared to 20% (CI 0%-40%) among those without the variant (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.19). The incidence of HC among patients with the variant in rs2279344 was 40% (CI 22%-58%) compared to 10% (CI 0%-28%) among those without (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.11). No variants in our analysis were statistically associated with HC. The data suggest that CYP2B6 variants may increase the risk for HC in FA patients who received a CY based preparative therapy but these risk variants must be further evaluated in a larger population.\n",

Studies show healthcare professionals' hand hygiene practices vary and are not at sufficient levels. This study aimed to examine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the beliefs and practices of nurses working in intensive care units (ICU) towards hand hygiene. This was longitudinal, repeated, and cross-sectional study. The study was conducted in 2 phases between January 2,2020 and March 10,2021 in the intensive care unit of a university hospital in northern Turkey. No sampling method was used. The objective was to reach the entire population. The first phase of this study was completed with 119 (76% of the population) ICU nurses and the second phase with 85 (70% of the population) ICU nurses. The data were collected with the personal information form, hand hygiene belief scale (HHBS), hand hygiene practices inventory (HHPI) and the views of the intensive care nurses related to COVID-19. Descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviations, frequency, and percentages and analytical statistics such as t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test were used for data analysis at the significance level of P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.05. The majority of the nurses who participated in the study were female (75.6%; 69.4%), with a mean age of 30.82&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;5.51 and 30.58&#x2005;&#xb1;&#x2005;5.51 years, respectively. There was a significant difference (P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.05) between the median HHBS (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.002) and HHPI (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.001) scores before and after COVID-19. All nurses (100%) reported that the pandemic was effective in hand hygiene practices. In this study, it was determined that the hand hygiene beliefs and practices of nurses were high, and the scores of nurses' hand hygiene beliefs and practices after COVID-19 increased significantly. Healthcare professionals must always adhere to stringent standards of hand hygiene, rather than merely during periods of heightened challenges. To ensure the sustainability of optimal hand hygiene practices, it is recommended that motivational interventions that strengthen beliefs and practices related to hand hygiene should be implemented and that studies should be conducted to evaluate their effectiveness.\n",

So, this study aimed to explore the association of smell and/or taste disturbance with disease severity and all-cause mortality among patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19. A retrospective cohort study (Nutrition and COVID-19 Study [NUTRICOVID19]) was conducted with 1331 patients (men and women, age&#x2005;&#x2265;&#x2005;18 years) hospitalized with COVID-19 between June and December 2020. Poisson and Cox regressions were used to investigate the unadjusted and adjusted associations between smell and/or taste disturbance and the following prognostic indicators: length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit admission, need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality. Patients with altered smell and/or taste had a shorter LOS (9 vs 11 days), were less likely to require IMV (22% vs 35.1%), and experienced lower mortality (17.1% vs 29.2%) compared to those without such symptoms. After multivariable adjustment, patients with smell and/or taste disturbances were 33% less likely to need IMV compared to those without such symptoms (RR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.50-0.88), but the relationship between these symptoms and mortality lost statistical significance. In this population of patients with COVID-19, the presence of smell and/or taste disturbances was associated to lower rates of IMV.\n",

Use of most antibiotics decreased during the 3-month period following the start of first lockdown (March 17, 2020), and these decreases persisted 12 months later. Some initial increases indicated potential stockpiling for antibiotics used for chronic indications. Azithromycin constituted a noticeable exception. In a context of reduced circulation of non-COVID-19 viruses, the observed decreases compared with forecasts could partly reflect habitual overuse of certain antibiotics.\n",

            "Four significant influenza outbreaks have occurred over the past 100&#x2009;years, and the 1918 influenza pandemic is the most severe. Since influenza viruses undergo antigenic evolution, they are the pathogens most likely to trigger a new pandemic shortly. Intranasal vaccination offers a promising strategy for preventing diseases triggered by respiratory viruses by eliciting an immunoglobulin A (IgA) response, limiting virus replication and transmission from the respiratory tract more efficiently than intramuscular vaccines. Combining intranasal administration and mRNA-lipid nanoparticles can be an ideal strategy for limiting the extent of the next flu pandemic. This study explored the immunogenicity of intranasally delivered mRNA encapsulated in mannose-histidine-conjugated chitosan lipid nanoparticles (MHCS-LNPs) as a vaccine against influenza A (H1N1) in BALB/c mice. Intranasal administration of mRNA-MHCS-LNPs resulted in the generation of influenza A (H1N1) hemagglutinin-specific neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated animals. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results indicated a notable increase in the quantity of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA antibodies in serum and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), respectively, and exhibited influenza A-specific IFN-&#x3b3; secretion in vaccinated mice, as well as a noticeable alteration in IL-5 production. Overall, this study demonstrated an effective immunogenic response against respiratory viral infections through intranasal delivery of an mRNA-MHCS-LNP vaccine.\n",

            "The rapid expansion of medication delivery service (MDS) during COVID-19 created many new roles in the pharmacy which are manpower intensive and not sustainable as pharmacy resumes counter collection services. To keep MDS operations sustainable, we identified the need to streamline and automate processes which are manual and repetitive. We seek to determine if the Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycles would effectively reduce the man-hours required for the MDS over two phases in 1 year. Phase 1 involved digitalisation of order taking and automation of the data entry process. Phase 2 involved automating the order generation and accounting process to replicate the patient information matching task which was performed manually during bagging and dispatch of delivery orders. The baseline period for this study was from December 2020 to January 2021. The results following implementation of PDSA cycles in the respective phases were collected between January 2021 to June 2021 and July 2021 to December 2021. The average time taken for data entry per delivery order reduced from a range of 0.5 to 2.15&#x2009;min to 0.08 to 0.1&#x2009;min depending on the ordering method (p&lt;0.05). The average time taken for bagging and dispatch per delivery order shortened from 2.7 min to 0.28 min (p&lt;0.05). The improvements were sustained and cumulatively contributed to 11.8-man-hour savings. The impact of the interventions was discussed. As MDS gains prominence as an important alternative for medication collection due to its rapid expansion due to COVID-19, it is crucial for the pharmacy to expand its capacity and information technology capabilities to cope with higher workload from both MDS and walk-in patients.\n",

            "Severe dengue is characterized by vascular leakage triggered by a hyperinflammatory response, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Our previous mouse model study highlighted the importance of small intestine in severe disease and identified key cytokines (IL-17A, TNF-&#x3b1;, and IL-6) involved. Here, we used a Fixed RNA Profiling assay to characterize key cytokine- and effector-producing cells, along with their receptor expression. Type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3), Th17 cells, and &#x3b3;&#x3b4; T cells emerged as pathologically relevant IL-17A/F<i>-</i>producing cells. These cells expressed IL-1&#x3b2; and IL-23 receptors, underscoring the significance of these signaling pathways. IL-1&#x3b2; was produced by M2-like macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, whereas M1-like macrophages, which differentiated post-infection, produced IL-23, TNF-<i>&#x3b1;</i>, and IL-6, acting as initiators and amplifiers of the cytokine storm. Newly differentiated neutrophils produced IL-1&#x3b2; and effector molecule matrix metalloprotease-8, suggesting a dual role in exacerbating the cytokine storm and directly mediating vascular leakage. Identified macrophages and neutrophils exhibited atypical characteristics. These findings provide new pathological insights into severe dengue and broader mechanism underlying cytokine storm-related diseases.\n",

            "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is widespread known as the sexually transmitted infection, which is responsible, for genital warts and certain types of cancer. Low-risks HPV types are responsible for genital warts. Genital warts can be treated through various medical and surgical methods. High-risks HPV types may cause dangerous cancers such as cervical cancer. The clinical approach in treatment of HPV-related cancers were different depending on the diseases stage ranging from surveillance and minor procedures for dysplasia to chemotherapy for more advanced cases. It is crucial to vaccinate adolescents against HPV to prevent infections from high risk strains. Researchers have explored natural products as potential solutions against viral infections with eight biologically active compounds. Including EGCG, curcumin, podophyllotoxin, resveratrol, pterostilbene, tanshinone IIA, indole-3-carbinol, and carrageenan. They are showing promising therapeutic effects in treating different stages of HPV-related diseases. Clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of EGCG and podophyllotoxin in treating warts while other compounds, like curcumin, resveratrol, pterostilbene, indole-3-carbinol, and tanshinone IIA offer benefits in combating cervical cancer. In addition, carrageenan shows promising effects in HPV transmission prevention. It appears that compounds from nature may have an impact, on different phases of the HPV infection like genital warts treatment, disease transmission prevention, and healing-related cancers. These findings highlight the potential of natural products as valuable sources to combat HPV infection and related cancers. Further more extensive studies are necessary to discover the effective mechanism of these natural compounds as anti-HPV agents.\n",

            "Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), an obligate intracellular acellular microbe, depends entirely on host cellular metabolism to accomplish viral replication. Glycolysis is a glucose metabolic pathway that generates adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and other intermediates that activate other metabolic pathways. However, the role of glycolysis in EV-A71 replication remains unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated the role and regulation of glycolysis in human tonsillar epithelial cells (HTECs) during EV-A71 infection. Concentration of glucose was decreased, the glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) level and lactate production were increased with upregulating the glucose transporter1 (Glut1) expression in EV-A71-infected HTECs. Moreover, cellular metabolism, including glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and cellular respiration were activated. PI3K/Akt pathway was also activated by EV-A71. Concentration of glucose was significantly increased but concentrations of G6P and lactate were significantly decreased along with decreased Glut1 protein level, and EV-A71 replication was also significantly suppressed when the glycolysis was inhibited by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) and sodium oxamate (Oxamate) treatments. A time-of-addition assay revealed that glycolysis regulated EV-A71 replication at the early (attachment/entry) and late (release) stages of the EV-A71 life cycle. Addition of glucose or lactate experiments showed too low or too high concentrations of glucose and excessive lactate impaired EV-A71 replication by decreasing Glut1 expression to inhibit glycolysis. Inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) also decreased EV-A71 replication. Finally, PI3K/Akt pathway inhibition severely reduced EV-A71 replication and G6P production. Therefore, these findings indicate that EV-A71 alters the host cellular metabolism to facilitate viral replication by exploiting glycolysis via the PI3K/Akt pathway, thereby providing a novel insight into the interaction between EV-A71 and host cells.\n",

Between October 2023 and April 2024, a total of 507 residents from 11 local government areas in northern Victoria - Mildura, Swan Hill, Campaspe, Gannawarra, Greater Bendigo, Loddon, Greater Shepparton, Moira, Wodonga, Wangaratta, and Indigo - were tested for MVEV total antibody. Seroprevalence was 2.0% (95% confidence interval: 1.1-3.6%), comparable to background levels of seropositivity prior to the 2023 outbreak. No strong associations were identified between a range of potential risk or protective factors and MVEV seropositivity. Low seroprevalence suggests that the population in this region remains immunologically vulnerable to MVEV infection. Ongoing vector control and efforts to prevent mosquito bites will be critical in preventing flavivirus transmission in northern Victoria during future mosquito seasons.\n",

The results of 2023 APSU surveillance show a marked increase in severe influenza cases for the first time in five years, with more complications associated with influenza type B. Moreover, one child died and only 6% of children received a seasonal influenza vaccine. The APSU also received reports of cases of rare emerging diseases: dengue, Q fever and PIMS-TS. Furthermore, our results show a persistence of vaccine-preventable JoRRP, mother-to-child transmission of HIV, and deaths from neonatal HSV.\n",

The adjuvanticity of flagellin (FliC) of <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium in mice was determined by combining it with the recombinant S1 subunit vaccine. FliC-adjuvanted S1 vaccine could induce significantly enhanced S1-specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgG1 and IgG2a titers, SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies, and levels of Th1 type (TNF-&#x3b1; and IFN-&#x3b3;) and Th2 type (Interleukin-5 (IL-5), IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13) cytokines in splenocytes compared with the S1 alone group. Additionally, the titers of S1-specific IgG antibodies in the FliC adjuvant group could maintain a high level for at least 2 months. These results indicated that the FliC-adjuvanted S1 subunit vaccine could trigger strong humoral and cellular immune responses, which could promote the ongoing development of COVID-19 vaccines.\n",

            "The teacher-student relationship has far-reaching implications for educational outcomes at the tertiary level. Teachers contribute to students' success in various ways, including academic support, career counseling, personal mentoring, etc., that help them succeed academically and professionally. COVID-19 disrupted teacher-student interaction and hindered the flow of teacher's support to students. The damage caused by the pandemic to the higher education sector has mostly recovered. However, the trusting relationship between teacher and student is yet to get back to a pre-pandemic stage. Using stratified sampling technique, we collected nationally representative data from university students in Bangladesh and examined the relationship between COVID-19 and various aspects of the teacher-student relationship. We also explored the association between aspects of the teacher-student relationship and academic outcomes. In our sample, 28% of respondents are from STEM, and 72% are from non-STEM academic disciplines. We employed a subset of Artificial Intelligence (unsupervised machine learning) algorithms K-Modes clustering and Non-negative matrix factorization to cluster the data according to its internal structure. We created a new analysis technique called Absolute Rate of Fluctuation (ARF) to identify the fluctuations between the variables. ARF can track the fluctuations in any relationship induced by undesirable events such as the COVID-19 outbreak. We observed a deterioration in the interaction between teachers and students during COVID-19. However, the class conduction, exam taking, and assessment system were the most affected areas compared to personal interaction, catering support to students, and collaborative research activities.\n",

            "The black-headed gull is the most common nesting gull species in Hungary. Based on the lifestyle and feeding habits of the black-headed gull, which is highly adapted to the human environment, they can be carriers and spreaders of potential human and other animal pathogens. Between 2014 and 2018 within the framework of the \"Life Bird Ringing program\" a total of 7 faecal samples were collected from gulls and one sample (MR04) was randomly selected for viral metagenomics and mass sequencing. 95.4% and 4% of the reads were classified into family Seadornaviridae and Astroviridae, respectively, and then were verified by RT-PCR method. In this study, the complete genome of a potential interspecies reassortant rotavirus (RV) strain gull/MR04_RV/HUN/2014 (PP239049-PP239059) and the partial ORF1ab, complete ORF2 of a novel avian nephritis virus strain gull/MR04_AAstV/HUN/2014 (PP239060) was discussed. The strain gull/MR04_RV/HUN/2014 was closely related to rotavirus G (RVG) viruses based on the proteins VP1-VP3, VP6, NSP2, NSP3, and NSP5, but it was more related to the human rotavirus B (RVB) strain Bang373 based on the NSP1, NSP4 and VP7, VP4 proteins, which is assumed to be the result of reassortment between different RVG-RVB rotavirus species. The strain gull/MR04_AAstV/HUN/2014 belonged to the genus Avastrovirus species avastrovirus 2 (AAstV-2) and is related to members of group 6 of avian nephritis viruses (ANVs), but based on the genetic distances it may be the first representative of a separate group. Additional gull samples were found to be negative by RT-PCR. Gulls, which are well adapted to the human environment, could potentially spread enterically transmitted viral pathogens like interspecies reassortant rotaviruses (RVG/RVB), but further molecular surveillance is needed to explore more deeply the viral communities of gulls or other related species adapted to human environments.\n",

            "The mental health of high-level athletes is a growing concern, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sleep is also an explicit health index closely related to mental health. This study aims to investigate the relationship between sleep, anxiety, depression, and perceived psychological stress among athletes, with a focus on sleep as a potential mediator in these mental health conditions. A comprehensive questionnaire included the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Athlete Psychological Stress Questionnaire (APSQ), and Athlete Sleep Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ), and was administered to a sample of 501 elite Chinese athletes. Statistical analysis software and structural equation modeling were used to examine the characteristics, correlations, and influence pathways of the four indicators. The findings indicated that, compared to previous studies, the prevalence of perceived psychological stress (78.6%) and sleep disorders (24.8%) in the athlete sample were higher. All three mental health indicators were significantly positively correlated with sleep disorders. In terms of influence pathways, there was a direct path from APSQ to PHQ-9, with the direct effect of perceived stress on depression accounting for 32.5%. The indirect paths from APSQ to GAD-7 to PHQ-9 and from APSQ to GAD-7 to ASSQ to PHQ-9 accounted for 67.5%. Sleep disorders in competitive athletes are closely related to mental health, potentially serving as an important observable health behavior indicator and mediating factor in the transition from anxiety to depression. There is a need to strengthen comprehensive intervention measures that combine mental health and sleep health behaviors for athletes.\n",

            "Immunity to viral infections is generally studied in isolation by measuring immune responses towards a single virus. However, concurrent or sequential viral co-infections can occur in a single host. Viral co-infections can impact antiviral immunity by altering protective responses and driving immunopathology. Understanding immune mechanisms towards co-infections with unrelated viruses is highly relevant to treatment and prevention. There is, however, paucity of data on immune responses towards viral co-infections, especially with unrelated viruses. Most commonly studied viral co-infections include chronic viruses, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as well as viruses infecting the same tissues, including respiratory viral co-infections. However, the immunological consequences of co-infections with unrelated acute viruses are less understood, especially for viruses affecting different anatomical sites. As co-infecting viruses can have a more pronounced impact on human health compared to infection with a single virus, understanding immune responses and, especially, the impact of timing, sequence and location of viral co-infections is of key importance. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge on acute viral co-infections with unrelated viruses, underpinning immune mechanisms and implications for vaccination regimens.\n",

            "Geosocial networking applications (GSN apps) are important tools for HIV/sexually transmitted infection prevention among men who have sex with men (MSM). Strategies for identifying high transmission and acquisition among GSN app users are needed to prioritize public health response. Community viral load (CVL) is associated with HIV transmission and can be used to identify populations with behaviors/environment associated with HIV/STI risk. We sought to determine user profile characteristics and utilization patterns associated with GSN app use in high CVL census tracts (CT). We used routine HIV surveillance data from in-care individuals and their viral loads at the point of diagnosis to estimate CVL in 200 CTs across Baltimore City. CTs were ordered based on CVL and categorized into quantiles from high to low. Among GSN user profiles, multiple imputation methods were used to complete missing profile characteristics. We then used imputed datasets to explore the association between profile characteristics, app utilization times, and app use in high CVL CTs using a Poisson regression model with robust error variances. Data on 606 profiles were collected originally and imputed 50 times to create a complete data set for analysis. GSN app users were aged 18-65 years [mean&#x2009;=&#x2009;33.9, 95% confidence interval (CI): 33.1-34.7], with 52.2% Black (95% CI: 47.9- 56.5%), 6.8% living with HIV (95% CI: 4.4- 9.2%), 39.1% in high CVL CTs (95% CI: 35.2- 43.0%), 50.6% use at nighttime (95% CI: 46.7- 54.6%) and 51.6% use during the weekend (95% CI: 47.6- 55.6%). Black MSM users [Relative risk (RR)&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.12, 95% CI: 1.04-1.20] were associated with GSN app use in high CVL CTs. MSM with profiles listing versatile sex position preference (RR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.12, 95% CI: 1.02-1.23) and profiles listing top sex position preference (RR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.13, 95% CI: 1.03-1.23) were associated with GSN app use in high and medium CVL CTs. GSN app user profiles of people in high and medium CVL CTs, especially Black MSM and those who report top and versatile sexual positions, may benefit from online prevention messages and real-time notification of health resources presently available in their communities to reduce HIV transmission.\n",

            "African swine fever is a highly contagious viral disease affecting domestic pigs and wild boars, caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV). ASFV exhibits highly restricted cell tropism, primarily targeting porcine macrophages for efficient and stable replication. This strict requirement for a specific cell type has posed significant challenges in ASFV research and remains a critical obstacle to vaccine development. Although several cell lines have been reported to support ASFV replication, significant genetic changes occur during passages in cell lines in unpredictable ways. In this study, we adapted a highly virulent Korean ASFV isolate to Vero cells, and plaque purification was employed during the early stages of cell adaptation to eliminate the competitive pressure between viral subpopulations. Three viral clones with distinct genetic properties were obtained and passaged independently up to 30 times. The three clones replicated efficiently in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and Vero cells even after 30 passages, while the parent virus did not grow in Vero cells. Genetic analysis revealed that the cell-adapted viral clones shared multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) but also had unique SNPs and large deletions in their genome. This diversity of mutations in these clones could provide a valuable model for exploring gene functions and their effects on phenotypic properties. Future studies will focus on evaluating the phenotypic effects of these SNPs in vivo to support vaccine development.\n",

            "White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) has been a major threat in shrimp farming system especially for penaeid shrimps. The lack of effective control measures for WSSV makes this disease a significant threat to aquaculture. This study seeks to explore the mechanisms of WSSV infection and its impact on shrimp by examining host-pathogen interactions (HPI) through in silico approach, which can offer valuable insights into the processes of infection and disease progression. The investigation focused on five Penaeus species, including Penaeus vannamei, Penaeus chinensis, Penaeus monodon, Penaeus japonicus, and Penaeus indicus, studying their interaction with the WSSV. This study employed orthology-based and domain-driven analyses to reveal protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between the host and the pathogen. The combined strategies were found to be effective in detecting shared molecular mechanisms in pathogenesis, unveiling intricate PPI networks critical for virulence and host response. Most interacting proteins in WSSV are immediate early proteins involved in DNA replication and proliferation, and are crucial for ubiquitination, transcription regulation, and nucleotide metabolism. A large number of host proteins interact with WSSV across species (2360-11,704 interactions), with P. chinensis (11,704) and P. japonicus (11,458) exhibiting the highest counts, suggesting greater susceptibility or response. Host hub proteins are crucial in signaling, cellular processes, and metabolism, interacting across the cytoplasm, nucleus, and membrane, highlighting their role in WSSV pathogenesis. This study provides essential insights into host-pathogen interactions, offering a foundation for future research aimed at improving WSSV control in shrimp aquaculture.\n",

            "Influenza A virus is a major human pathogen, and its replication is widely studied. One important aspect for effective virus propagation is the host cell, since cellular properties can limit or favor virus entry, viral genome and viral protein synthesis and virus release. To establish detailed mathematical models for these processes, quantitative experimental data on the intracellular dynamics of viral compounds together with the number of infectious and non-infectious virus particles released are required. In this study, we report results obtained from an optimized mass spectrometry assay for the quantification of viral proteins that was applied to compare the production of influenza A virus HA, NP, NA, M1, and NS1 proteins for different seed viruses and host cells of batch cultures. With canine MDCK cell-adapted seed virus, a maximum of about 1.0E+08 copies/cell were found for all five viral proteins after infection of avian AGE1.CR and human HEK293 cells. These intracellular levels are about fivefold lower than in MDCK cells. However, after five passages of seed virus adaptation, intracellular protein copy numbers comparable to those in MDCK cells were achieved. Highest levels were found for the NS1 protein with about 1.0E+09 copies/cell. Furthermore, the onset of virus particle release started earlier for both cell lines (about 3-6 h). In contrast, the maximum virus titers did not change for AGE1.CR cells but increased for HEK293 cells. Nevertheless, the highest HA titers were always obtained for MDCK cells. Overall, the experimental data indicate that influenza A virus replication is different due to specifics of innate host cell immune response, viral protein production, precursor consumption, and degradation rates. KEY POINTS: &#x2022; Application of absolute quantification for five major proteins of influenza A virus. &#x2022; NS1 protein most abundant protein with 1.0E+09 copies/cell at the end of infection. &#x2022; Virus adaptation leads to earlier release and higher virus titers in HEK293 cell.\n",

HBoV-1 has been primarily associated with respiratory symptoms, while HBoV2-4 are mostly found in gastrointestinal (GI) samples. Results from case-control studies are still controversial; however, epidemiological evidence has shown a significant association between HBoV-2 and gastroenteritis. This review will primarily focus on this association, with a brief discussion of evidence related to other HBoV genotypes. Pathological and molecular studies on the pathogenesis of HBoV, particularly in GI cells, are very scarce, possibly due to the difficulties of in vitro HBoV culture. Nonetheless, some relevant findings from colorectal cancer samples have yielded valuable insights regarding the behavior of HBoV in the GI system. In the present review, we provide an updated overview of the epidemiological evidence for an association of HBoV infection with acute gastroenteritis and focus on the cellular and molecular perspectives of HBoV pathogenicity. Finally, we look at the knowledge gaps about how HBoV affects the GI system and explore future directions.\n",

Recently, pre-fusion F protein vaccines for RSV have received food and drug administration (FDA) approval to protect adults aged 60 years and older; however, vaccines evaluated against RSV typically do not elicit complete or durable protective immunity. We previously showed that an RSV G protein central conserved domain (CCD) nanoparticle vaccine containing an S177Q mutation (NP-S177Q) induced favorable immunogenicity and RSV-neutralizing antibodies compared with RSV G protein vaccination alone in mice. Boosting BALB/c mice with NP-S177Q vaccines improved correlates of protection and reduced markers of immunopathology following RSV challenge. This study examined microparticle (MP) vaccines displaying the CCD with an RSV G S177Q mutation (MP-S177Q) adjuvanted with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) in BALB/c mice. Our findings show that mice adjuvanted MP-S177Q vaccination develop effective viral neutralization compared with MP-WT and MP-S177Q vaccination and have improved bronchoalveolar Th1-type cytokine responses following the RSV challenge compared with MP-WT or vehicle-vaccinated mice.

            "Equitable spatial accessibility to vaccination sites is essential for enhancing the effectiveness of infectious disease prevention and control. While traffic modes significantly influence the evaluation of spatial accessibility to vaccination sites, most existing studies measure it separately using homogeneous or single travel modes making it challenging to comprehensively understand the overall accessibility and support spatial optimization for vaccination sites. This study proposes to optimize the spatial distribution of vaccination sites based on heterogeneous travel modes in multiple scenarios by a hybrid travel time approach. This was done by first considering heterogeneous travel modes to measure spatial accessibility to vaccination sites followed by spatial optimization using hybrid travel time to determine the optimal configuration of vaccination sites across multiple scenarios. In the study area of Xiangtan, a prefecture-level city in east-central Hunan Province, China, spatial inequality in accessibility to COVID-19 vaccination sites were identified. The public in the Yuhu and Yuetang districts benefit from easy access to vaccination sites, and spatial accessibility within these areas is also equitable. By utilizing spatial optimization under the condition that the addition of a new site would not result in a comprehensive hybrid travel time increase exceeding 0.1%, up to 21 redundant sites were detected among the original ones and when newly added sites were considered, the optimal number of the optimized sites amounted to 124. These findings provide crucial spatial information to support for enhancing the efficiency of infectious disease prevention and control.\n",

            "Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus (e.g. H5N1) infects the lower airway to cause severe infections, and constitute a prime candidate for the emergence of disease X. The nasal epithelium is the primary portal of entry for respiratory pathogens, serving as the airway's physical and immune barrier. While HPAI virus predominantly infects the lower airway, not much is known about its interactions with the nasal epithelium. Hence, we sought to elucidate and compare the differential responses of the nasal epithelium against HPAI infection that may contribute to its pathology, and to identify critical response markers. We infected human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) cultured at the air-liquid interface from multiple healthy donors with clinical isolates of major human seasonal influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2, influenza B) and HPAI H5N1. The infected cells were subjected to virologic, transcriptomic and secretory protein analyses. While less adapted to infecting the nasal epithelium, HPAI H5N1 elicited unique host responses unlike seasonal influenza. Interestingly, H5N1 infection of hNECs induced responses indicative of subdued antiviral activity (e.g. reduced expression of IFN&#x3b2;, and inflammasome mediators, IL-1&#x3b1; and IL-1&#x3b2;); decreased wound healing; suppressed re-epithelialization; compromised epithelial barrier integrity; diminished responses to oxidative stress; and increased transmembrane solute and ion carrier gene expression. These unique molecular changes in response to H5N1 infection may represent potential targets for enhancing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for better surveillance and management of HPAI infection in humans.\n",

            "Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) is an important pathogen that has long been a significant threat to small ruminant productivity worldwide. Iron metabolism is vital to the host and the pathogen. However, the mechanism underlying host-PPRV interactions from the perspective of iron metabolism and iron-mediated membrane lipid peroxidation has not been reported thus far. In this study, we identified a novel host long-noncoding RNA (lncRNA), APR, that impairs PPRV infectivity by sponging miR-3955-5p, a negative microRNA (miRNA) that directly targets the gene encoding the ferritin-heavy chain 1 (FTH1) protein. Importantly, we demonstrated that PPRV infection causes aberrant cellular iron accumulation by increasing transferrin receptor (TFRC) expression and that iron accumulation induces reticulophagy and ferroptosis, which benefits PPRV replication. Moreover, PPRV infection enhanced the localization of cellular iron on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and caused ER membrane damage by promoting excess lipid peroxidation to induce reticulophagy. Interestingly, APR decreased PPRV infection-induced accumulation of intracellular Fe<sup>2+</sup> via miR-3955-5p/FTH1 axis and ultimately inhibited reticulophagy and ferroptosis. Additionally, our results indicate that interferon regulatory factor 1 promotes APR transcription by positively regulating APR promoter activity after PPRV infection. Taken together, our findings revealed a new pattern of PPRV-host interactions, involving noncoding RNA regulation, iron metabolism, and iron-related membrane lipid peroxidation, which is critical for understanding the host defense against PPRV infection and the pathogenesis of PPRV.IMPORTANCEMany viruses have been demonstrated to engage in iron metabolism to facilitate their replication and pathogenesis. However, the mechanism by which PPRV interacts with host cells from the perspective of iron metabolism, or iron-mediated membrane lipid peroxidation, has not yet been reported. Our data provide the first direct evidence that PPRV infection induces aberrant iron accumulation to promote viral replication and reveal a novel host lncRNA, APR, as a regulator of iron accumulation by promoting FTH1 protein expression. In this study, PPRV infection increased cellular iron accumulation by increasing TFRC expression, and more importantly, iron overload increased viral infectivity as well as promoted ER membrane lipid peroxidation by enhancing the localization of cellular iron on the ER and ultimately induced ferroptosis and reticulophagy. Furthermore, a host factor, the lncRNA APR, was found to decrease cellular iron accumulation by sponging miR-3955-5p, which directly targets the gene encoding the FTH1 protein, thereby attenuating PPRV infection-induced ferroptosis and reticulophagy and inhibiting PPRV infection. Taken together, the results of the present study provide new insight into our understanding of host-PPRV interaction and pathogenesis from the perspective of iron metabolism and reveal potential targets for therapeutics against PPRV infection.\n",

            "HIV pandemic continues to affect key populations more than the general population, namely young men who have sex with men (MSM) [UNAIDS. (2023). <i>The path that ends AIDS: UNAIDS global AIDS update 2023</i>. Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/2023-unaids-global-aids-update_en.pdf]. This study aimed to identify and better understand the attitudes and behaviours associated with HIV transmission in young MSM, and their awareness and motivation to use pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). In 2022 and 2023, we interviewed 23 MSM between 20 and 30 years old. A hybrid methodology - inductive and deductive - was used for content analysis. Trust in partners, drug use, fetishisation regarding condomless sex and yielding to a partner's desire due to lack of assertiveness were highlighted as motivations for unprotected sex. Shame and fear of stigma were identified as potential inhibitory factors for HIV testing. Some concerns and lack of awareness regarding PrEP were noted, along with barriers to access, due to long waiting times for consultations and lack of knowledge or judgment by healthcare professionals. This study reinforces the need to invest in sex education and empowerment strategies, through a sexual orientation-sensitive approach, in the context of health education and care provision, as well as the need for training and streamlining PrEP fast-track protocols.\n",

            "Comorbidities, including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are associated with increased disease severity and mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we investigated virus-host interactions under the effects of these comorbidities in diet-induced obesity (DIO) and leptin receptor-deficient (T2DM) mice following infection with SARS-CoV-2. DIO mice, as well as their lean counterparts, showed limited susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, T2DM mice showed exacerbated pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 replication and delayed viral clearance associated with down-regulation of innate and adaptative immune gene signatures, ineffective type I interferon response, and delayed SARS-CoV-2-specific cell-mediated immune responses. While T2DM mice showed higher and prolonged SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin isotype responses compared to their lean counterparts, neutralizing antibody levels were equivalent. By silencing the leptin receptor <i>in vitro</i> using a human alveolar epithelial cell line, we observed an increase in SARS-CoV-2 replication and type I interferons. Altogether, our data provides for the first time evidence that disruption of leptin receptor signaling leading to obesity and T2DM induces altered type I interferon and cell-mediated responses against SARS-CoV-2, mediating increased viral replication and delayed clearance. These data shed light on the alteration of the innate immune pathway in the lung using in-depth transcriptomic analysis and on adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 under T2DM conditions. Finally, this study provides further insight into this risk factor aggravating SARS-CoV-2 infection and understanding the underlying cellular mechanisms that could help identify potential intervention points for this at-risk population.\n",

            "Nanoblades are viral particles loaded with the Cas9 protein complexed with gRNA, which allowed efficient gene editing in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Combined with recombinant adeno-associated vector (rAAV) 6 containing two homologous arms to a gene locus resulted in 50% of expression cassette knockin into HSPCs. However, high effective doses of rAAV6 induced HSPC cell death. Here, we demonstrated that, at high doses, rAAV2 was much less toxic for template DNA delivery and allowed transduction levels in HSPCs equivalent to rAAV6. To improve donor template delivery, rAAV2 and rAAV6 were chemically bio-conjugated with a mannose ligand, via the lysine or tyrosine amino acid residues exposed at the adeno-associated vector (AAV) capsid surface. High-level transduction of HSPCs with mannose-coupled rAAV6 vectors accompanied by a remarkable lower toxicity was achieved as compared to control rAAV6 in correlation with highly reduced p53 pathway activation. Mannose-conjugated rAAV6 combined with nanoblades allowed efficient gene knockin and increased survival of HSPCs from 10% to 80% as compared to the unmodified rAAV6 even in the most immature CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38lowCD90<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population. Summarizing, mannose-conjugated rAAV6 maintained high-level donor mediated gene knockin when combined with nanoblades without inducing significant toxicity for the HSPCs, an important feature for clinical translation of HSPC gene-editing strategies.\n",

            "Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is a severe cutaneous reaction characterized by the sudden onset of numerous sterile, non-follicular pustules on an erythematous and edematous background, usually associated with fever. AGEP is commonly triggered by medications, including antibiotics, anticancer agents, and hydroxychloroquine, but infections and vaccinations, such as parvovirus B19 and COVID-19 vaccines, have also been implicated. We report a case of AGEP which developed two days after the administration of cephalexin. The pathological findings of subcorneal pustules and European Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (EuroSCAR)&#xa0;score of 9 confirmed the diagnosis of AGEP. To date, only six cases of cephalexin-induced AGEP have been reported. Among these, five cases involved patients without underlying conditions, while one case occurred in a patient with pustular psoriasis undergoing treatment. Although all six cases were diagnosed based on clinical and histopathological findings, our case is the only one in which the EuroSCAR score has been used for definitive diagnosis. Interestingly, viral infections have been suggested as potential triggers for AGEP. In the present case, the patient had pre-existing cold symptoms before taking cephalexin, raising the possibility that a viral infection contributed to AGEP onset. Viral infections are known to induce CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activation, which&#xa0;in combination with drug exposure&#xa0;may lead to excessive infiltration of inflammatory T-cells into the skin, resulting in increased production of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-36. This mechanism could explain why AGEP may develop more readily in the presence of a viral infection. Further accumulation of cases and research is needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms.\n",

            "Previous research has identified air pollution as a relevant non-infectious trigger for episodic &#x2018;lung attacks&#x2019;, referred to as exacerbations, in patients living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Very few studies, however, have studied this relationship during the COVID-19 pandemic. During that time, there were large fluctuations in key forms of air pollution (air pollutants). The few studies available used population-level approaches and relied on hospital administrative coding of visits to classify the disease and to identify exacerbation events. This approach may lead to potentially missing clinically important non-severe events and may limit individual-level risk factor assessment around this period. This study was conducted in participants with COPD as confirmed by the gold-standard test, spirometry, who were living in 9 Canadian cities across 6 provinces. The results showed that while the air pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), and total oxidant (O<sub>x</sub>) concentrations were all notably higher before the pandemic (pre-pandemic), only ambient O<sub>x</sub> concentration was consistently associated with exacerbations. This relationship was seen across both pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. Female gender, co-morbid asthma, and eosinophilia were identified as notable risk factors for exacerbations and were effect modifiers for the association between O<sub>x</sub> exposure and exacerbations. This study adds to a very limited existing literature on the relationship between air pollutant fluctuations and exacerbations of COPD around the pandemic era and highlights important risk factors to guide targeted public health and exposure response interventions.\n",

A 21-year-old male patient was admitted with multiple fractures after a motorcycle accident. Shortly after the debridement of the open fracture and external fixation of the bones, the patient presented with hypoxemia, tachypnea, fever, and tachycardia. There were no neurologic abnormalities and no petechial rash. Supportive care, including mechanical ventilation, was required. Initial chest angiotomography did not detect pulmonary thromboembolism. There were discrete bilateral consolidations in the lung bases - no bacterial or viral infection findings, including a negative COVID-19 test. Computed tomography was repeated after 5&#xa0;days, evidenced by bilateral well-demarcated ground glass opacities. Our case presented an atypical presentation of fat embolism syndrome, without classical signs and symptoms, such as neurologic abnormalities and petechial rash. In this context, other differential diagnoses were considered, since the clinical manifestations of fat embolism are non-specific, and often are seen in other post-traumatic conditions. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of fat embolism syndrome in the Intensive Care Unit. Atypical presentation must be taken into consideration when treating high-risk patients.\n",

            "Pandemics pose significant threats to social, economic, and public health. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which emerged in late 2019, quickly became a global public health crisis due to its high contagion and pathogenicity. Using data from the World Health Organization (WHO), this study applied the Logistic model to analyze the spread patterns of COVID-19 in 16 countries with over 10 million infections from 2020 to 2023. The findings reveal that as of December 31, 2023, global infections exceeded 772 million with over seven million deaths. The USA and China had the highest infection numbers, while Brazil had the highest mortality rate. The study identified three main outbreak patterns: initial, late, and gradual development, reflecting different stages of the pandemic. Countries with earlier outbreaks, such as India, Brazil, the USA, and Argentina, generally had higher mortality rates, while those with later outbreaks, such as China, Pakistan, Japan, and Australia, had lower mortality rates. Significant differences were observed in the duration and speed of the spread, with China showing the shortest average duration and Russia the longest. The Logistic model's parameter <i>k</i> values revealed policy adjustments, with Australia, Vietnam, and China showing significant changes over time, while the USA, France, and Russia showed less impact on epidemic control. These results provide an important perspective for understanding global pandemic transmission patterns and assessing the effectiveness of quarantine strategies across countries. They also provide a scientific basis for future public health policy and pandemic response development, helping countries to develop more targeted prevention and control strategies according to the characteristics of virus transmission, rationally allocate medical resources, and reduce social harm.\n",

            "Viral genomes encode viral transcriptional regulators (vTRs) that manipulate host gene expression to facilitate replication and evade immune detection. Nevertheless, their role in non-cancerous diseases remains largely underexplored. Here, we unveiled 268 new candidate vTRs from 14 of the 20 viral families we investigated. We mapped vTRs' genome-wide binding profiles and identified their potential human targets, which were enriched in immune-mediated pathways, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancers. Through vTR DNA-binding preference analysis, 283 virus-specific and human-like motifs were identified. Prioritized Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) vTR target genes were associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. The partitioned heritability study among 19 diseases indicated significant enrichment of these diseases in EBV vTR-binding sites, implicating EBV vTRs' roles in immune-mediated disorders. Finally, drug repurposing analysis pinpointed candidate drugs for MS, asthma, and Alzheimer disease. This study enhances our understanding of vTRs in diverse human diseases and identifies potential therapeutic targets for future investigation.\n",

The analysis shows that D614G and P681 mutations occurred in both phases. The E484 and Y655 mutations significantly emerged during the second phase. The 762-889 and 254-381 regions are revealed as conserved parts and could be considered in vaccine design. The Kruskal-Wallis test revealed a significant reduction in single mutations between populations with 20%-50% and those with 70%-100% vaccination coverage (p=0.017). The Mann-Whitney U test proposes a link between vaccination and suppression of viral mutation rates. Dynamic modeling suggests that key mutations have facilitated the virus' evolution and immune escape. The study's findings are crucial for understanding virus genome mutations, especially E614 and P681 in Delta and E484 and H655 in Omicron. This highlights the need to adjust strategies and strengthen global efforts in combating the pandemic.\n",

This editorial examines a recent study by Xu <i>et al</i> who developed models to predict MVI and high-risk (M2) status in HBV-related HCC using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) radiomics and clinicoradiological factors. The study analyzed 270 patients, creating models that achieved an area under the curve values of 0.841 and 0.768 for MVI prediction, and 0.865 and 0.798 for M2 status prediction in training and validation datasets, respectively. These results are comparable to previous radiomics-based approaches, which reinforces the potential of this method in MVI prediction. The strengths of the study include its focus on HBV-related HCC and the use of widely accessible CECT imaging. However, limitations, such as retrospective design and manual segmentation, highlight areas for improvement. The editorial discusses the implications of the study including the need for standardized radiomics approaches and the potential impact on personalized treatment strategies. It also suggests future research directions, such as exploring mechanistic links between radiomics features and MVI, as well as integrating additional biomarkers or imaging modalities. Overall, this study contributes significantly to HCC management, paving the way for more accurate, personalized treatment approaches in the era of precision oncology.\n",

            "Sequence diversity of the hepatitis D virus (HDV) may impact viral clearance, contributing to the development of chronic infection. T-Cell-induced selection pressure and viral recombination can induce diversity throughout the viral genome including coding and noncoding regions, with the former potentially impacting viral pathogenicity and the latter exerting regulatory functions. Here, we aim to assess sequence variations of the HDV genome within and across HDV genotypes. Sequences from 721 complete HDV genomes and 793 large hepatitis D antigen (L-HDAg) regions belonging to all eight genotypes and published through December 2023 were compiled. Most retrieved sequences belonged to Genotype 1, whereas for Genotype 8, the fewest sequences were available. Alignments were conducted using Clustal Omega and Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform. Phylogeny was analysed using SplitsTree4, and recombination sites were inspected using Recombination Detection Program 4. All reported sequences were aligned per genotype to retrieve consensus and reference sequences based on the highest similarity to consensus per genotype. L-HDAg alignments of the proposed reference sequences showed that not only conserved but also highly variable positions exist, which was also reflected in the epitope variability across HDV genotypes. Importantly, <i>in silico</i> binding prediction analysis showed that CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell epitopes mapped for Genotype 1 may not bind to major histocompatibility complex class I when examining their corresponding sequence in other genotypes. Phylogenetic analysis showed evidence of recombinant genomes within each individual genotype as well as between two different HDV genotypes, enabling the identification of common recombination sites. The identification of conserved regions within the L-HDAg allows their exploitation for genotype-independent diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, while the harmonized use of the proposed reference sequences may facilitate efforts to achieve HDV control.\n",

There have been several cases reporting development of new-onset psychosis after upper respiratory illnesses, including influenza and more recently coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Here, we present a case of a previously healthy African American female with no history of mental illness who developed psychotic symptoms following an upper respiratory illness in three distinct episodes at the ages of 16, 18, and 21. The patient had extensive medical workup during these episodes which did not identify an infectious source despite clear signs and symptoms of infection. Her psychiatric symptoms included disorganization, paranoia, response to internal stimuli and one episode with catatonic features. These symptoms improved with initiating antipsychotic treatment, and complete resolution was achieved within a couple months in the outpatient setting. In this report, we detail the disease course, medical workup, and selection of psychotropic treatments. This case highlights the challenges with identifying the diagnosis, completing appropriate workup, and selecting the best management for patients with similar presentations. It further demonstrates the connection between viral illnesses and development of psychosis and underscores the importance of further research to better understand patients with similar presentations.\n",

Intracellular inhibitors are critical regulators of T cell activation, and their function can be influenced by viruses. Because of less studied aspects of HTLV-1 in T cell activation, we evaluated three suppressor genes in patients with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and asymptomatic carriers (ACs). Thirty samples were collected from three groups from 10/09/2022 to 03/27/2024. To confirm all the samples, ELISA and PCR tests were done. The isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), RNA extraction, and cDNA synthesis were conducted. Subsequently, the expression of <i>Tax trans-activator, HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ), protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A),</i> and two E3 ligases, including <i>Casitas B</i> <i>lymphoma-b (Cbl-b)</i> and <i>itchy E3 Ubiquitin protein ligase (ITCH),</i> was measured via Real-time PCR. This survey showed a significant increase in ITCH among individuals with HAM/TSP and ACs compared to the healthy group. The <i>PP2A</i> mRNA expression level was upregulated in the ACs; in contrast, the expression levels were approximately similar in the HAM/TSP and healthy groups. Also, the mean expression level of <i>Cbl-b</i> was higher in the ACs than in the other groups; however, it was not statistically significant. Our findings demonstrated that the intercellular suppressor genes could be dysregulated during the HTLV-1 infection, probably as part of the virus's strategic goals. The findings can be helpful for future investigation in the diagnosis and treatment area.\n",

Globally, the ASDR of influenza-associated LRIs was 3.29/100,000 in 2019, which was higher in the African region (6.57/100,000) and among adults aged 70 years and older (29.88/100,000). The ASDR of influenza-associated LRIs decreased significantly from 1990 to 2019 (AAPC = -1.88%, P &lt; 0.05). However, it was significantly increased among adults aged 70 years and older during 2017-2019 (APC = 2.31%, P &lt; 0.05), especially in Western Pacific Region and South-East Asia Regions. The ratio of death rates between adults aged 70 years and older and children aged under 5 years increased globally from 1.63 in 1990 to 5.34 in 2019, and the Western Pacific Region experienced the most substantial increase, with the ratio soaring from 1.83 in 1990 to 12.98 in 2019. Despite a decline in the global ASDR of influenza-associated LRIs, it continues to impose a significant burden, particularly in the African, Western Pacific regions and among the elderly population.\n",

Azithromycin (AZM) has garnered significant attention for its distinctive pharmacological mechanisms in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. This study aims to elucidate the biological rationale for employing AZM in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Genetic data about COVID-19, COPD, and IPF were independently obtained from the GeneCards database. And 40 drug targets about AZM were retrieved from the STITCH database. The analysis revealed that 311 DEGs were common among COPD, IPF, and COVID-19, and we further found eight genes that interacted with AZM targets. We conducted an analysis of hub genes and their corresponding signaling pathways in these patient cohorts. Additionally, we explored the inhibitory effects of AZM on these hub genes. AZM demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect on eight key genes, except for AR and IL-17&#xa0;A. These findings suggest that AZM may serve as a promising therapeutic agent for patients with COPD and IPF and SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n",

            "Dengue fever is a viral disease predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions. The mild form presents with fever and flu-like symptoms, whereas the severe form can cause significant bleeding, a drastic drop in blood pressure, and even death. A mathematical model was developed consisting of ten classes: seven for humans and three for mosquitoes. The model was then reduced to eight classes to better simulate the transmission dynamics of the dengue virus. In numerical experiments, it was fitted to dengue infection data from 2022 and from 2004 to 2022 in Nepal using the least squares method. Sensitivity analysis identified the parameters with the most significant influence on the basic reproduction number. Conclusions The model has been validated to ensure the positivity and boundedness of solutions. The basic reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) was derived using the next-generation matrix approach. We have analytically and graphically demonstrated that both the Dengue-free and endemic equilibrium points are locally and globally stable. Additionally, the presence of a forward bifurcation was confirmed through the Center Manifold theory. Sensitivity analysis identified the parameters with the most significant influence on the basic reproduction number. Finally, the model equations were numerically solved using the Runge-Kutta (ODE45) method to assess the impact of key parameters on the system's behavior. Moreover, we analyzed the economic and psychological effects of dengue fever on hospitalized patients in Nepal from 2004 to 2022 and projected the disease trend through 2030. Furthermore, this study was compared with the three other articles in terms of methodology and model design.\n",

            "The rapid success of RNA vaccines in preventing SARS-CoV-2 has sparked interest in their use for cancer immunotherapy. Although many cancers originate in mucosal tissues, current RNA cancer vaccines are mainly administered non-mucosally. Here, we developed a non-invasive intranasal cancer vaccine utilizing circular RNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles to induce localized mucosal immune responses. This strategy elicited potent anti-tumor T cell responses in preclinical lung cancer models while mitigating the systemic adverse effects commonly associated with intravenous RNA vaccination. Specifically, type 1 conventional dendritic cells were indispensable for T cell priming post-vaccination, with both alveolar macrophages and type 1 conventional dendritic cells boosting antigen-specific T cell responses in lung tissues. Moreover, the vaccination facilitated the expansion of both endogenous and adoptive transferred antigen-specific T cells, resulting in robust anti-tumor efficacy. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that the vaccination reprograms endogenous T cells, enhancing their cytotoxicity and inducing a memory-like phenotype. Additionally, the intranasal vaccine can modulate the response of CAR-T cells to augment therapeutic efficacy against tumor cells expressing specific tumor-associated antigens. Collectively, the intranasal RNA vaccine strategy represents a novel and promising approach for developing RNA vaccines targeting mucosal malignancies.\n",

Routine diagnostic methods are insufficient to identify all viral pathogens in this region. In this study, 1281 febrile Ugandan patients were prospectively recruited as part of the CDC-UVRI Acute Febrile Illness Study and pre-screened for common pathogens. 210/1281 undiagnosed samples, and 20 additional samples from viral outbreaks were subjected to metagenomic sequencing. Viral pathogens were identified in 44/230 (19%), including respiratory, hepatitis, blood-borne, gastrointestinal and vector-borne viruses. Importantly, one case of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever and two cases each of Rift Valley fever, dengue and yellow fever were detected in 7/230 (3%) of cases. Le Dantec virus, last reported in 1969, was also identified in one patient. The presence of high-consequence and (re-)emerging viruses of public health concern highlights the need for enhanced population-based diagnostic surveillance in the African region.\n",

            "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common viral infection acquired in utero and a leading cause of neurodevelopmental abnormalities, including sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). In previous studies using a murine model of HCMV induced SNHL, hearing loss was correlated with virus-induced cochlear inflammation but not cochlear viral load. However, these previous findings were determined at the time of auditory testing, a time poiont well past critical periods of auditory development. In the current study, cochlear virus load early in auditory development could be correlated with the magnitude of virus-induced cochlear inflammation, cochlear histopathology and the development of hearing loss. Transcriptional profiling at early times after infection revealed dysregulation of multiple well described deafness-related genes (DRG). Treatment with antiviral antibodies early after infection decreased cochlear virus load, cochlear inflammation, cochlear histopathology, and normalized DRG expression arguing that virus-induced cochlear inflammation can result in pleiotropic effects on the developing auditory system. Finally, this model also demonstrated that sterilizing immunity was unnecessary for prevention of SNHL, thus providing a rationale for inteventions that could limit, but not completely prevent HCMV infection of the developing auditory system.\n",

            "The catecholamine neurotransmitter dopamine is classically known for regulation of central nervous system (CNS) functions such as reward, movement, and cognition. Increasing evidence also indicates that dopamine regulates critical functions in peripheral organs and is an important immunoregulatory factor. We have previously shown that dopamine increases NF-&#x3ba;B activity, inflammasome activation, and the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1&#x3b2; in human macrophages. As myeloid lineage cells are central to the initiation and resolution of acute inflammatory responses, dopamine-mediated dysregulation of these functions could both impair the innate immune response and exacerbate chronic inflammation. However, the exact pathways by which dopamine drives myeloid inflammation are not well defined, and studies in both rodent and human systems indicate that dopamine can impact the production of inflammatory mediators through both D1-like dopamine receptors (DRD1, DRD5) and D2-like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4). Therefore, we hypothesized that dopamine-mediated production of IL-1&#x3b2; in myeloid cells is regulated by the ratio of different dopamine receptors that are activated. Our data in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) indicate that DRD1 expression is necessary for dopamine-mediated increases in IL-1&#x3b2;, and that changes in the expression of DRD2 and other dopamine receptors can alter the magnitude of the dopamine-mediated increase in IL-1&#x3b2;. Mature hMDM have a high D1-like to D2-like receptor ratio, which is different relative to monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We further confirm in human microglia cell lines that a high ratio of D1-like to D2-like receptors promotes dopamine-induced increases in IL-1&#x3b2; gene and protein expression using pharmacological inhibition or overexpression of dopamine receptors. RNA-sequencing of dopamine-treated microglia shows that genes encoding functions in IL-1&#x3b2; signaling pathways, microglia activation, and neurotransmission increased with dopamine treatment. Finally, using HIV as an example of a chronic inflammatory disease that is substantively worsened by comorbid substance use disorders (SUDs) that impact dopaminergic signaling, we show increased effects of dopamine on inflammasome activation and IL-1&#x3b2; in the presence of HIV in both human macrophages and microglia. These data suggest that use of addictive substances and dopamine-modulating therapeutics could dysregulate the innate inflammatory response and exacerbate chronic neuroimmunological conditions like HIV. Thus, a detailed understanding of dopamine-mediated changes in inflammation, in particular pathways regulating IL-1&#x3b2;, will be critical to effectively tailor medication regimens.\n",

            "Opportunistic infections (OIs) are the leading cause of hospitalisation and mortality among Human Immunodeficiency Virus-infected (HIV-infected) patients. The diverse pathogen types and intricate clinical manifestations associated present a formidable challenge to the timely diagnosis of these infections. This study aims to use machine learning techniques to develop a diagnostic model that quickly identifies whether HIV-infected patients have any type of OIs, without being limited to specific infections, thus adapting to various clinical scenarios. This study is a retrospective cohort study that collected clinical data from HIV-infected patients at four healthcare organisations in China. A total of twelve machine learning classification algorithms were employed for the purposes of model training and evaluation. Additionally, feature reduction was conducted through the implementation of an importance ranking, with the objective of eliminating any redundant features. In conclusion, both the five features based on Shapley additive explanations (procalcitonin, haemoglobin, lymphocyte, creatinine, platelet) and the five features based on Permutation Importance explanations (procalcitonin, lymphocyte, haemoglobin, creatinine, indirect bilirubin) achieved the highest F1 score when evaluated using the adaptive boosting classifier model. The scores on the test set were 0.9016 and 0.9063, respectively, which significantly outperformed the best 32-feature model, gradient boosting classifier, which had a test set F1 score of 0.8991.\n",

            "The 2021 importation of wild poliovirus serotype 1 (WPV1) into Malawi with subsequent international spread represented the first WPV1 cases in Africa since 2016. Preventing importations and spread of WPV1 is critical and dependent on population immunity provided through routine immunisation (RI) and supplementary immunisation activities (SIAs). We aim to estimate outbreak risk and costs, given the importation of WPV1 for non-endemic countries in the WHO Africa region. We developed a stochastic mathematical model of polio transmission dynamics to evaluate the probability of an outbreak, expected number of poliomyelitis cases, costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios under different vaccination strategies. Across variable RI coverage, we explore three key strategies: RI+outbreak SIAs (oSIAs), RI+oSIAs+annual preventative SIAs (pSIAs) and RI+oSIAs+biennial pSIAs. Results are presented in 2023 USD over a 5year- time horizon from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) and health system perspectives. The annual pSIA strategy has the greatest probability of no outbreaks in comparison to other strategies: under our model assumptions, annual pSIAs result in an 80% probability of no outbreaks when RI coverage is &#x2265;50%. The biennial pSIA strategy requires RI coverage &#x2265;65%&#x2009;to achieve an equivalent risk of no outbreaks. The strategy with no pSIAs requires &#x2265;75%&#x2009;RI coverage to achieve an equivalent risk of no outbreaks. For the health system, when RI coverage is between 35% and 60%, both pSIA strategies are cost-saving. For the GPEI, below 65% RI pSIA strategies are cost-effective, but the biennial pSIA strategy incurs higher costs in comparison to annual pSIAs due to more oSIAs required to stop outbreaks. Prioritisation of pSIAs must balance outbreak risk against implementation costs, ideally favouring the smallest manageable outbreak risk compatible with elimination. We infer that there are few short-term risks due to population immunity from RI, but without pSIAs, long-term risks accumulate and can result in outbreaks with the potential for international spread.\n",

These include imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and positron emission tomography (PET), which noninvasively visualize brain structure and activity; electrophysiological techniques that measure intracellular potentials and currents and analyze cell electrical properties to understand brain activity; techniques to explore how gene expression affects brain function; genetic methods such as gene knockout/knock-in to study how brain cells function; and computational neuroscience methods such as mathematical modeling and simulation to understand the principles of how brain networks operate. Among these, recent advances, particularly the development of 'single-cell omics analysis,' have led to a paradigm shift in neuroscience research. This technique allows the comprehensive study of the unique genetic and molecular characteristics of individual brain cells at the single-cell level. In this paper, I review the application of single-cell omics analysis, which has advanced dramatically in recent years, to various neuroscience problems, mainly how it contributes to the structure and function of neural circuits, a modality unique to the cranial nervous system.\n",

            "Cervical cancer (CC) is the primary cause of cancer-related mortality among women in developing countries and is the most prevalent disease linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Over 70&#x202f;% of CC cases result from persistent infections with high-risk HPV types. The virus typically targets the mucocutaneous epithelium, generating viral particles in mature epithelial cells, which leads to disruptions in normal cell-cycle regulation and promotes uncontrolled cellular proliferation. This unchecked cell division results in the accumulation of genetic damage, contributing to the pathogenesis of CC. While HPV infection is a key etiological factor, the disease's progression also necessitates the involvement of genetic and epigenetic influences. One of the epigenetic regulators, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), are characterized by transcripts exceeding 200 nucleotides. These molecules play crucial roles in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation, RNA metaboli35 per 100,000sm, and apoptosis. Investigating the specific roles of lncRNAs in modulating gene expression related to the oncogenic mechanisms of CC, particularly in the context of high-risk HPV infections, may provide valuable insights for diagnostic and therapeutic advancements. Herein, we first review key molecular mechanisms by which lncRNAs interfere with CC-related HPV development. Then, diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic potentials of these lncRNA molecules will be highlighted in depth. The focus of this article is on the role of lncRNAs associated with HPV-related CC, emphasizing the investigation of signaling pathways and their underlying molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, we explore the therapeutic potential and diagnostic relevance of the most significant lncRNAs in the context of CC, thereby highlighting their importance in advancing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes.\n",

It was first identified in 2001, hMPV has displayed a seasonal pattern of infection, with symptoms ranging from moderate to severe respiratory disease. This study investigates the worldwide effect of hMPV, concentrating on its transmission, etiology, diagnostics, and treatment techniques, underlining the need for better public health measures. hMPV is spread by respiratory droplets, with a normal incubation period of 3-5 days. The virus induces an immune response characterized by pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to respiratory symptoms and probable tissue damage. Diagnostic breakthroughs, including RT-qPCR and mNGS, have enhanced detection sensitivity. However, therapy is generally supportive, with potential breakthroughs in mRNA vaccines targeting hMPV fusion proteins. Current clinical studies evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these new vaccinations, which might pave the road for effective prevention. Despite tremendous gains in understanding hMPV, there remains a crucial need for targeted antiviral treatments and vaccines to minimize its worldwide health impact.\n",

            "Avian Leukosis Virus (ALV) can induce tumorigenesis and immune suppression by acting on lymphocytes in the bone marrow. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to analyze chicken bone marrow lymphocytes under Avian Leukosis Virus subtype J (ALV-J) infection. Using subgroup-specific marker genes and cell state analysis, we identified 18 distinct cell clusters, including 8 T cell clusters, 2 B cell clusters, 5 tumor-like cell clusters, and 3 unidentified clusters. Gene expression analysis revealed that in the 10 T/B lymphocyte clusters, the differentially expressed genes in double-positive T cells, B1-like B cells, and cytotoxic T cells were highly enriched in pathways related to viral infection and immune response. These three cell populations exhibited high proportions and significant changes after infection, suggesting a strong immune response to ALV-J infection. Additionally, during ALV-J infection, the proportion of regulatory T cells and CTLA4 T cells increased, while immune suppressive factors TGFB1 and IL16 were highly expressed across the cell populations, indicating an immune-suppressive state in bone marrow lymphocytes. Moreover, ALV-J infected all cell populations; however, within the same cluster, only a fraction of the cells expressed ALV-J viral genes. Notably, in all cells expressing ALV-J viral genes, the \"Rho family GTPase signaling pathway\" associated with antiviral responses was activated. The Rho family, which is a key regulator of cytoskeletal reorganization and cell polarity, also plays a critical role in tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. Further analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software predicted key upstream regulators of immune response, such as MYC and MCYN. In conclusion, this study identifies key genes and signaling pathways involved in immune responses of different lymphocyte subpopulations triggered by ALV-J infection in bone marrow. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the immune mechanisms in ALV-J-infected bone marrow lymphocytes and provide insights for discovering breeding loci for ALV-J resistance.\n",

            "Pathogenic mutations in the Gjb2 gene, encoding connexin 26, are the leading cause of autosomal-recessive hereditary deafness. Gene therapy holds significant promise for treating this. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated therapeutic gene delivery has been shown to be safe and effective in restoring hearing in both animal models and human patients. However, Gjb2 gene therapy has been hindered by the limited specificity and efficiency of the available AAV vectors. In this study, we screened AAV serotypes and found that co-administration of AAV1 and AAV-ie could effectively target Gjb2-expressing cells. However, the ectopic Gjb2 expression in hair cells induced by these AAVs could cause ototoxicity, which was addressed by employing the specific promoter SCpro. Co-injection of AAV1 and AAV-ie carrying exogenous Gjb2 driven by SCpro effectively restored hearing function in Gjb2-deficient mice. Moreover, the combined AAV system can transduce the cochleae of Bama miniature pigs and AAV administration into the inner ear of cynomolgus monkeys did not impair hearing and showed negligible systemic toxicity, indicating the efficiency and safety of this gene therapy in large animals. Thus, this study provides a strategy for Gjb2 gene therapy and lays a foundation for future clinical applications.\n",

            "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, our understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation in alveolar epithelial cells remains very limited. The contributions of intracellular insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP2) to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis are also unclear. In this study, we have uncovered a critical role for IGFBP2, specifically in alveolar epithelial&#xa0;type&#xa0;2 cells (AEC2), in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. Using bulk RNA sequencing, we show that IGFBP2 mRNA expression is significantly downregulated in primary AEC2 cells isolated from fibrotic lung regions from patients with COVID-19-acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared to those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) alone or IPF with a history of COVID-19. Using multicolor immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that IGFBP2 and its selective ligands IGF1 and IGF2 were significantly reduced in AEC2 cells from patients with COVID-ARDS, IPF alone, or IPF with COVID history than in those from age-matched donor controls. Further, we demonstrated that lentiviral expression of Igfbp2 significantly reduced mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines-Tnf-&#x3b1;, Il1&#x3b2;, Il6, Stat3, Stat6 and chemokine receptors-Ccr2 and Ccr5-in mouse lung epithelial cells challenged with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein injury (S2; 500&#xa0;ng/mL). Finally, we demonstrated higher levels of cytokines-TNF-&#x3b1;; IL-6 and chemokine receptor-CCR5 in AEC2 cells from COVID-ARDS patients compared to the IPF alone and the IPF with COVID history patients. Altogether, these data suggest that anti-inflammatory properties of IGFBP2 in AEC2 cells and its localized delivery may serve as potential therapeutic strategy for patients with COVID-19.\n",

The PVN was created as a new initiative under the Pacific Public Health Surveillance Network (PPHSN). This launch was a critical step in the build-up to PVN as a full-service network of PPHSN in the coming years. The Pacific Island Countries and areas (PIC)-led network comprises vector management leadership, officers, and technical partners dedicated to supporting information-sharing to promote evidence-based collective action and innovation. The setup of a Technical Working Body to ensure governance and to steer forward the work of the network was a key deliverable. This manuscript describes the proceedings and discussions of PIC representatives and several regional partners at the inaugural PVN meeting held 5-7 June 2023 in Hawai'i, USA.\n",

            "The meat industry showcases the precarity of employment arrangements as part of broader global economic liberalization. In many countries, its workforce consists mostly of precariously employed immigrant and resident foreign-born workers. Categorized as \"essential workers\", they worked throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, while facing high infection risk. Using case-studies in three country contexts - Illinois/USA, the Netherlands, and North Rhine-Westphalia/Germany - we analyzed policy documents, investigative reports, publicly available data, and informal expert consultation to examine structural causes of protection gaps for workers in the meat industry as well as facilitators and barriers to improving occupational safety and health. The Framework Method was applied to systematize and compare the overall data.Our analysis yields two key findings: First, immigrant workers in the meat industry face similar structural conditions across country contexts, with intersecting immigration- and employment-related precarity, generating gaps in social and health protection and deficiencies in the realization of theoretically held rights. Second, as policy responses to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks varied, our case-studies showcase fundamentally different approaches to state responsibility for worker wellbeing as part of food supply chain (FSC) governance. The sacrificial-worker approach, observed in Illinois/USA, prioritized industry interests over worker and public health. In the Netherlands, a passive government delegated responsibilities to industry actors who forestalled systemic change through ad hoc adjustments, leaving the core problem of workers' precarity intact. In Germany, the government leveraged the COVID-19 pandemic as a catalyst for change by enforcing a ban on subcontracting workers in the meat industry, with the potential to fundamentally shift industrial relations and thus address the root causes of worker precarity. Our results highlight economic liberalization and related worker precarity as central determinants of health inequities; and they underscore the imperative for more equitable social and health protection of all workers as part of FSC governance, and as part of food systems transformation for sustainability.\n",

            "Medical treatments using potent neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have achieved remarkable improvements in clinical symptoms, changing the situation for the severity of COVID-19 patients. We previously reported an antibody, NT-108 with potent neutralizing activity. However, the structural and functional basis for the neutralizing activity of NT-108 has not yet been understood. Here, we demonstrated the therapeutic effects of NT-108 in a hamster model and its protective effects at low doses. Furthermore, we determined the cryo-EM structure of NT-108 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike. The single-chain Fv construction of NT-108 improved the cryo-EM maps because of the prevention of preferred orientations induced by Fab orientation. The footprints of NT-108 illuminated how escape mutations such as E484K evade from class 2 antibody recognition without ACE2 affinity attenuation. The functional and structural basis for the potent neutralizing activity of NT-108 provides insights into the rational design of therapeutic antibodies.\n",

            "Interspecies transmission of viruses poses significant risks to animal and human health. Tembusu virus (TMUV), an emerging flavivirus, is primarily associated with avian diseases. This study reports the first documented natural infection of TMUV in mammals, specifically zoo dolphins in Thailand, offering insights into its evolution, transmission dynamics, and zoonotic potential. In July 2023, three bottlenose dolphins developed neurological symptoms and died. Postmortem analyses, including histopathology, immunohistochemistry, high-throughput sequencing, and transmission electron microscopy, confirmed TMUV infection. Viral loads were high in brain and lung tissues, followed by kidney and spleen whereas the TMUV antigen was identified in only brain tissue. TMUV was localized in neurons and astroglia cells, and immunohistochemistry revealed CD3-positive T lymphocyte perivascular cuffing in the brain. Phylogenetic analysis placed the dolphin TMUV strains within cluster 3, related to strains found in mosquitoes in China. Retrospective analysis of dolphin samples from 2019 confirmed persistent TMUV circulation. Viral isolation on Vero cells showed characteristic cytopathic effects, and transmission electron microscopy revealed enveloped virions. This study highlights the virus's ability to infect diverse hosts, including mammals. The findings underscore the need for continuous surveillance and a One Health approach to mitigate emerging viral threats.\n",

            "Honghe Prefecture, Yunnan Province, China, is a key area affected by HIV/AIDS. Given the high number of infected individuals, understanding HIV transmission in this region is crucial to controlling the epidemic in Yunnan Province. A molecular epidemiology study with 1004 newly diagnosed HIV-1 cases in 2022 was conducted to characterize transmission and guide targeted interventions. Of the 833 samples genotyped, nine HIV-1 genotypes were identified, with CRF08_BC (56.7%), URFs (17.8%), CRF07_BC (13.9%) and CRF01_AE (7.1%) being the most prevalent. These genotypes were widely distributed but concentrated in the center and east of the prefecture. Molecular network analysis showed varying clustering rates among counties, with Luxi County having the highest and Honghe County the lowest. Low education levels were associated with higher clustering. Cross-county transmission patterns were revealed, with strong links between specific counties. Of the three spatial subdivisions identified by the cohesive subgroup analysis, subgroup I included eight counties running from northeast to southwest. Persons aged 50-59&#xa0;years and ethnic minorities were more likely to be identified in cross-county transmission. Notably, the overall prevalent level of HIV-1 pre-treatment drug resistance was 6.2% (50/809), with higher levels in Luxi (18.2%, 8/44), Hekou (14.3%, 3/21) and Yuanyang (10.9%, 13/119). This study investigated HIV-1 transmission patterns using molecular network analysis in a hotspot of HIV transmission, and informed the application of HIV molecular surveillance in practice.\n",

Vaginal swabs of healthy mares were evaluated for the presence of PVs to investigate whether the vaginal virobiota of asymptomatic mares harbored OaPVs. High-performance digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) was used to quantitatively detect OaPV types 1-4 DNA in 94 vaginal swabs collected at the National Reference Center for Veterinary and Comparative Oncology (CEROVEC), Genoa, Italy. All samples were comparatively evaluated for OaPV DNA loading using real-time quantitative PCR. ddPCR detected OaPV DNA in 25 vaginal swab samples (26.6%), whereas qPCR revealed 13 vaginal swabs (11.7%). Differences between the two molecular protocols were determined to be statistically significant using McNemar's test (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0005). The detected OaPV types were OaPV1 and OaPV3. Both methods failed to detect OaPV2 or OaPV4 DNA, which could be attributed to the limited number of samples examined. OaPV1 is the most prevalent OaPV in equine vaginal virobiota . This study is the first to provide evidence of the presence of OaPV DNA in vaginal swabs of healthy mares. This comparative detection approach underscores the superior sensitivity of ddPCR over qPCR.\n",

            "African swine fever (ASF) has spread to many Southeast Asian countries, affecting domestic pig farms and wild boars. This is especially prevalent in areas where human settlements, domestic animals, and wildlife intersect. Our study suggests using the Random Forest (RF) technique to predict the presence or absence of wild boars and estimate their population density in a specified area. We suggest using data from the Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART) to estimate the wild boar population in Southeast Asian countries, particularly in mainland Southeast Asia. Our findings indicate a relatively high abundance of free-ranging wild boars in protected areas of northwest Thailand, where there is a significant interface between domestic pig farms and wild boars bordering Myanmar. Wild boars were also observed in the northern region, bordering Lao PDR, and in the central and southern regions of Thailand. These findings highlight the need for ASF surveillance in border areas. The study also found that the presence of wild boars is linked to deep forest cover, elevation, and distance to water bodies, in contrast, a high density of human population, rainfed cropland, and irrigated cropland were negatively associated. These results are valuable for planning risk mitigation strategies against ASF infection in wild boars and domestic pigs in Thailand and Southeast Asia for transboundary disease surveillance.\n",

            "We previously showed that Polyphenol rich sugarcane extract (PRSE) displayed significant inhibitory effect against influenza A virus (IAV). In this study, we investigated the mechanism of action (MOA) of PRSE against respiratory viruses in human-derived cells. We showed that PRSE treatment does not promote an antiviral state via expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). We subsequently investigated any potential perturbation on the viral entry process and observed that PRSE treatment did not affect caveolin-mediated endocytosis but led to a significant attenuation in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We confirmed this inhibitory effect on IAV entry, as infection was unaffected by PRSE when IAV fusion was induced at the plasma membrane, instead of endosomal membranes. Based on these findings we observed significant inhibitory effect of PRSE against respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus, which utilise clathrin-mediated endocytosis, but not human parainfluenza virus type 3, which fuses at the plasma membrane. In conclusion, we show that PRSE has broad antiviral activity and potentially perturbs virus entry via clathrin-mediated endocytosis to inhibit viral replication in vitro.\n",

            "The threat of emerging infectious diseases (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 the RNA virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic) has highlighted the importance of accurate and rapid testing for screening, patient diagnosis, and effective treatment of infectious disease. Nucleic acid diagnostic tools such as qPCR are considered the gold standard, providing a sensitive, accurate, and robust method of detection. However, these conventional diagnostic platforms are resource intensive, limited in some applications, and are almost always confined to laboratory settings. With the increasing demand for low-cost, rapid, and accurate point-of-care diagnostics, CRISPR-based systems have emerged as powerful tools to augment detection capabilities. Of note is the potent RNA detection enzyme, Leptotrichia buccalis (Lbu) Cas13a, which is capable of rapid RNA detection in complex mixtures with or without pre-amplification. To support its wide-spread use, we describe a detailed method for the expression, purification, and validation of LbuCas13a for use in molecular diagnostics.\n",

            "Daxx and HIRA are key proteins in the host response to DNA virus infections. Daxx is involved in apoptosis, transcription regulation, and stress responses. During DNA virus infections, Daxx helps modulate the immune response and viral progression. Viruses like adenoviruses and herpesviruses can exploit Daxx to evade immune detection, either by targeting it for degradation or inhibiting its function. Daxx also interacts with chromatin to regulate transcription, which viruses can manipulate to enhance their own gene expression and replication. HIRA is a histone chaperone and reported to be essential for chromatin assembly and gene regulation. It plays a critical role in maintaining chromatin structure and modulating gene accessibility. During DNA virus infection, HIRA influences chromatin remodeling, affecting both viral and host DNA accessibility, which impacts viral replication and gene expression. Additionally, the histone variant H3.3 is crucial for maintaining active chromatin states. It is incorporated into chromatin independently of DNA replication and is associated with active gene regions. During viral infections, H3.3 dynamics can be altered, affecting viral genome accessibility and replication efficiency. Overall, Daxx and HIRA are integral to orchestrating viral infection programs, maintaining latency and/or persistence, and influencing virus-induced transformation by modulating chromatin dynamics and host immune responses, making them significant targets for therapeutic strategies once fully understood. Here, we summarize various DNA viruses and their crosstalk with Daxx and HIRA.\n",

            "Identifying the cause of respiratory tract infections is important for reducing the burden of diagnosis and treatment. To assess viral etiologies of hospitalized patients with pulmonary infection (including patients with lower respiratory tract infection, tuberculosis, lung cancer, and pulmonary nodules), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) specimens were collected from non-COVID-19 adult patients (n = 333) between November 2020 and November 2021. Multiple common respiratory pathogens were detected using multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The result showed that at least one virus was identified in 35.44% (118/333) of the cases. Among these, influenza virus was the most commonly identified, followed by the parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, human rhinoviruses, and human respiratory syncytial viruses. The tuberculosis group demonstrated the highest viral detection rate, yet paradoxically exhibited the lowest co-infection rate. In contrast, the highest co-infection frequency was observed in the pulmonary nodules group. Patients with viral infections exhibited more severe clinical symptoms compared to those without detected viral infections. However, this observation was only noted in the lower respiratory tract infection group among the different disease groups. Notably, among patients infected with a specific virus, there were no significant differences in viral load between single and co-infections. Our study identified the major causative agents in hospitalized adult patients with pulmonary infection, offering insights for precise disease diagnosis and the prevention of unnecessary use of antimicrobial drugs.\n",

            "As one of the most primitive vertebrates, fish have evolved a distinct repertoire of viral recognition receptors. However, the existence of nuclear viral recognition receptors in fish remains uncertain. In this study, we identified a scaffold attachment factor A (SAFA), CiSAFA, as a potential nuclear recognition receptor for grass carp reovirus (GCRV) in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). CiSAFA shares high amino acid sequence similarity (70.3-99.6&#xa0;%) and identity (56.1-98.6&#xa0;%) with its counterparts from other vertebrates and contains three conserved domains, namely, SAP, SPRY, and AAA_33. On the basis of the subcellular location analysis, CiSAFA was found to localize to the nucleus. In vitro, CiSAFA can bind to poly(I:C) and induce interferon (IFN) expression. The expression data revealed that CiSAFA exhibited ubiquitous mRNA expression across all the tissues of grass carp. After GCRV infection, CiSAFA showed significantly upregulated mRNA expression levels and exhibited an expression pattern similar to that of IFN1 in the spleen and head kidney. The results of RNA immunoprecipitation indicated that CiSAFA might interact with dsRNA segment 6 of GCRV. The overexpression of CiSAFA significantly increased the expression levels of several representative antiviral genes, including interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), IRF7, IFN1, and virus-induced gene 1 (GIG1), and inhibited GCRV replication. To our knowledge, this study represents the first discovery of a potential nuclear recognition receptor, CiSAFA, for GCRV in grass carp and reveals its antiviral immune mechanism against GCRV infection, which may provide new insight into host immune recognition system-virus interactions in fish.\n",

Identifying individuals at heightened risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for targeted interventions and preparedness. This study investigated 35 SNVs within viral infection-associated genes in SARS-CoV-2 patients and uninfected controls from the Basque Country (March 2020-July 2021). Its primary aim was to uncover genetic markers indicative of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and explore genetic predispositions to infection. Association analyses revealed previously unreported associations between SNVs and susceptibility. Haplotype analyses uncovered novel links between haplotypes and susceptibility, surpassing individual SNV associations. Descriptive modelling identified key susceptibility factors, with rs11246068-CC (IFITM3), rs5742933-GG (ORMDL1), rs35337543-CG (IFIH1), and GGGCT (rs2070788, rs2298659, rs17854725, rs12329760, rs3787950) variation in TMPRSS2 emerging as main infection-susceptibility indicators for a COVID-19 pandemic situation.

            "The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented, and presently, the world is facing a new challenge known as post-COVID syndrome (PCS). Current estimates suggest that more than 100 million people are grappling with PCS, encompassing several manifestations, including pulmonary, musculoskeletal, metabolic, and neuropsychiatric sequelae (cognitive and behavioral). The mechanisms underlying PCS remain unclear. The present study aimed to: (i) comprehensively characterize the acute effects of pulmonary inoculation of the betacoronavirus MHV-A59 in immunocompetent mice at clinical, cellular, and molecular levels; (ii) examine potential acute and long-term pulmonary, musculoskeletal, and neuropsychiatric sequelae induced by the betacoronavirus MHV-A59; and to (iii) assess sex-specific differences. Male and female C57Bl/6 mice were initially inoculated with varying viral titers (3x10<sup>3</sup> to 3x10<sup>5</sup> PFU/30&#x202f;&#x3bc;L) of the betacoronavirus MHV-A59 via the intranasal route to define the highest inoculum capable of inducing disease without causing mortality. Further experiments were conducted with the 3x10<sup>4</sup> PFU inoculum. Mice exhibited an altered neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio in the blood in the 2nd and 5th day post-infection (dpi). Marked lung lesions were characterized by hyperplasia of the alveolar walls, infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and mononuclear leukocytes, hemorrhage, increased concentrations of CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL1 chemokines, as well as high viral titers until the 5th dpi. While these lung inflammatory signs resolved, other manifestations were observed up to the 60 dpi, including mild brain lesions with gliosis and hyperemic blood vessels, neuromuscular dysfunctions, anhedonic-like behavior, deficits in spatial working memory, and short-term aversive memory. These musculoskeletal and neuropsychiatric complications were exclusive to female mice and prevented after ovariectomy. In summary, our study describes for the first time a novel sex-dependent model of PCS focused on neuropsychiatric and musculoskeletal disorders. This model provides a unique platform for future investigations regarding the effects of acute therapeutic interventions on the long-term sequelae unleashed by betacoronavirus infection.\n",

            "American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (ATL) comprises a group of diseases caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus. The endosymbiont Leishmania RNA Virus 1 (LRV1) has been associated with severe disease forms and treatment failure in several South American countries; however, no data are available for Argentina. This study conducted the first screening for LRV1 in the country's most endemic region, Salta Province, analyzing 44 clinical samples from cutaneous, mucosal, and relapsing ATL cases. All samples were identified as Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis by PCR-RFLP, and tested negative for LRV1 using RT-PCR. Applying a zero-patient design to avoid concluding absolute absence, the theoretical LRV1 prevalence was estimated to be below 7%, substantially lower than the 25-77% range reported in Amazonian regions. These findings suggest that LRV1 distribution may not extend into Argentina. While LRV1 may contribute to disease severity when present, it should not be regarded as an exclusive or definitive factor in clinical presentation or therapeutic response in the region. Further research into genetic, immunological, and epidemiological factors is needed to better understand severe ATL forms in Argentina and to develop targeted strategies for improved disease management.\n",

            "Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are crucial for the nuclear import of viral genomes, serving as gateways for many viruses to deliver their genetic material into host cell nuclei. However, the role of NPCs in the entry of Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) remains poorly understood. This study investigates the involvement of specific nucleoporins in the nuclear import of BmNPV nucleocapsids, a crucial step for viral replication in host cells. Using a combination of Importazole, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), we demonstrate that BmNPV entry into BmN cells is mediated through the NPC. Importazole and WGA treatment significantly inhibited viral infection, highlighting the essential role of nucleoporins in BmNPV entry. Additionally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Nup358 and Nup153 resulted in a marked accumulation of nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm. Overexpression of the N-terminal fragment of Nup358 (1-1127) enhanced nucleocapsid entry efficiency, whereas deletion of the phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats in Nup153 (Nup153<sup>&#x394;FG</sup>) reduced viral entry. These results confirm the pivotal roles of Nup358 and Nup153 in the nuclear import of BmNPV nucleocapsids. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular interactions between BmNPV and host NPCs, offering potential targets for controlling BmNPV infections in sericulture.\n",

This study aimed to characterize the pathotype, genotype, evolutionary divergence, and mutations of circulating virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in chickens from the Gazipur, Tangail, and Mymensingh districts of Bangladesh between October 2023 and December 2024. ND-suspected samples, including lung, trachea, and caecal tonsil tissues, were collected, processed, and inoculated into 10-12-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs) via the allantoic cavity. Allantoic fluids were harvested after 24&#xa0;h of incubation, and virulent NDV was identified through RT-PCR targeting the fusion (F) gene using specific primers. Pathogenicity was assessed using the mean death time (MDT), intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI), and intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI). The pathotype and genotype were confirmed by complete sequencing of the F gene and phylogenetic analysis. Further evolutionary divergence and mutations were analyzed using MEGA-11 software. RT-PCR yielded specific amplification of a 254-bp product indicative of virulent NDV. Pathogenicity indices-MDT (&lt;60&#xa0;h), ICPI (&gt;1.5), and IVPI (&gt;1.70)-confirmed a velogenic strain. Complete F gene sequencing revealed an F-protein cleavage site motif of \"RRQKRF,\" while phylogenetic analysis classified the isolates as belonging to sub-genotype XIII.2.3 under genotype XIII. Evolutionary divergence (0.00-0.06) and mutations at neutralizing epitopes 1 and 2 (at the 74th and 170th amino acids, respectively) suggested moderate genetic diversity. This study represents the first report in Bangladesh identifying the emergence of the novel sub-genotype XIII.2.3 of genotype XIII NDV associated with chicken mortality in selected regions.\n",

The pathophysiology of liver disease is rooted in oxidative stress. The present study aims to investigate the presence of oxidative stress during the liver lesion process in FAdV-4 infection. Specifically, one-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were allocated into three groups, the control group, the infection group, and the quercetin group. The quercetin group received daily oral administration of quercetin. At the age of 12 days, the chickens belonging to both the infection and quercetin groups were subjected to intramuscular injection of FAdV-4 (0.3 mL10<sup>3</sup>TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL). Samples were collected from each group at 2, 4, and 6 days post-infection (dpi), and sera were collected to measure the levels of ALT and AST. A portion of liver tissue was fixed to examine the histological changes, cell apoptosis, and mitochondrial morphology, while another portion was homogenized and mitochondria were isolated. The levels of MDA, SOD, H2O2, and GSH-Px in the homogenate supernatants of livers and isolated mitochondria were measured, and the viral load in the liver was studied. And Cyt C levels in the mitochondria and cytosolic supernatant were recorded. The results showed that AST and ALT in the serum of chicken in the infection group were significantly higher than those in the control and quercetin group at 6 dpi. Obvious swelling, steatosis, necrosis, and inflammatory cell infiltration were observed in the liver of the infection group. Administered with quercetin can significantly decrease the viral load in the liver at 4 and 6 dpi. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the liver, and MDA, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, GSH and SOD levels in mitochondria in the hepatocyte of the infection group were significantly higher than those in the control and quercetin groups. Cyt C in the mitochondria of the hepatocyte of infection and quercetin groups were significantly lower than those in the control group at 2 dpi. Cyt C in the cytoplasm of the liver in chicken in the quercetin group was significantly higher than those in the control and infection groups. It was found that the outer mitochondrial membrane in hepatocytes was fractured in the infection group. The proportion of apoptotic cells in the liver in the infection groups was significantly higher than those in the control and quercetin group at 4 dpi, and that in the control group was significantly lower than in the infection and quercetin group. The results suggested that during liver injury induced by FAdV-4 infection, oxidative damage occurred obviously in the liver and mitochondria, and hepatocyte apoptosis was observed. Quercetin, as an antioxidant, can inhibit virus replication to some extent, and alleviate oxidative damage, liver damage, and the mortality caused by FAdV-4 infection.\n",

            "Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) is one of the most severe malignant T-cell leukemia/lymphomas induced by human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1). HTLV-1 persists in the host through stratagems of proliferating infected cells and evading host immunity. HTLV-1 encodes two viral oncogenes, tax and HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ), which are related with protection from cell death and promotion of cell proliferation. In addition, HBZ and the somatic mutations in host genes, such as C-C chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) and CIC, convert HTLV-1-infected cells into regulatory T (Treg)-like cells, leading to evasion of host immunity. A recent study demonstrated the key mechanisms for clonal expansion of HTLV-1-infected cells; the activation of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x3b2; signaling pathway by HBZ not only converts HTLV-1-infected cells into a Treg-like cells through Foxp3 expression, but also contributes to the proliferation of HTLV-1-infected cells themselves. Due to the longevity induced by HTLV-1 infection, somatic mutations and epigenetic aberrations are accumulated in infected clones, contributing to the oncogenesis of ATL. Collectively, the long-term survival of infected cells enabled by the HTLV-1's stratagems for persistent infection ultimately leads to ATL oncogenesis via the accumulation of genetic/epigenetic abnormalities.\n",

            "Wastewater-based epidemiological (WBE) surveillance has emerged as a crucial tool for monitoring infectious diseases within communities. However, its broader application is frequently constrained by the high costs, labor-intensive processes, and extended timeframes required for sample collection, transportation, and processing. Aptamer-based biosensors offer a promising alternative, leveraging the specific binding properties of aptamers to biomolecules for the on-site and rapid quantification of disease biomarkers in wastewater. This review systematically evaluates recent advancements in the application of aptamer-based biosensors for the detection of key pathogens, including influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, and norovirus, within wastewater matrices. The discussion encompasses the technical stability and reliability of signal transmission associated with these biosensors, as well as the current challenges faced in real-world implementation. Noteworthy progress has been made in the development of these biosensors for WBE, achieving detection limits as low as femtomolar (fM) levels in buffer and linear dynamic ranges extending up to five orders of magnitude for viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Despite this progress, considerable hurdles remain to be addressed before these technologies can be effectively deployed in practical settings, especially within complex wastewater environments. Key factors affecting detection performance include matrix interference, environmental variability, and the diminished stability of both viral targets and aptamer-target interactions in wastewater. This review not only highlights these challenges but also outlines potential avenues for future research aimed at enhancing the functionality and applicability of aptamer-based biosensors in WBE, ultimately contributing to more effective public health surveillance and disease monitoring strategies.\n",

            "Coronaviruses have emerged as a significant challenge to human health. While earlier outbreaks of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV posed serious threats, the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has heightened interest in coronavirus research due to its pulmonary pathology, in addition to its neurological manifestations. In addition, the patients who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection show long-term symptoms such as anosmia, brain fog and long COVID. A major hurdle in studying these viruses is the limited availability of specialized research facilities, emphasizing the need for prototype virus-based models to investigate the pathophysiology. The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a member of the &#x3b2;-coronavirus family, serves as an excellent model to unravel the mechanisms underlying virus-induced pathogenesis. This review highlights two decades of research efforts aimed at understanding the pathophysiological mechanism of coronavirus-induced diseases, focusing on the development of targeted recombinant strains to identify the minimal essential motif of the spike protein responsible for fusogenicity and neuropathogenicity. By synthesizing findings from these studies, the review identifies the most promising therapeutic targets against coronaviruses, paving the way for the development of pan-coronavirus antivirals.\n",

            "Pseudorabies virus (PRV), the causative agent of Aujeszky's disease, is an infectious pathogen that significantly impacts the global swine industry. The broad host range of PRV enables it to infect various animals, including pigs, cattle, minks, dogs, and even humans. Although PRV infections in ruminants have been reported, the occurrence of natural PRV infection in goats has not been documented. In this study, we present compelling evidence through the characterization of clinical symptoms and detection and analysis using polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and sequence alignment, demonstrating the first case of a PRV variant infection that led to acute illness and death in goats in Yunnan Province, China. Our results indicated that all 10 serum samples from fattening pigs raised near the infected goats tested positive for PRV, suggesting that the PRV infection in goats may have resulted from shared feeding with PRV-infected fattening pigs. Consequently, this report not only underscores the potential threat posed by newly emerging PRV variant strains to the goat industry but also emphasizes the necessity for the development of effective and safe vaccines against PRV variants for goats and other ruminants in the future.\n",

            "Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) has been demonstrated to trigger a variety of malignant neoplasms, however, there are currently no targeted pharmaceutical interventions available. MicroRNA(miRNA)-based antiviral and tumor therapies are frequently utilized, yet the challenges of cellular uptake and susceptibility to degradation underscore the necessity for a delivery system that can effectively combat KSHV. Nonetheless, despite the efficacy of nanocarriers in delivering drugs into cells, they continue to encounter challenges in penetrating the brain. In this study, a macrophage inflammation model was developed to enhance the delivery of miR-34a-5p loaded by folic acid-modified &#x3b2;-cyclodextrin grafted polyethyleneimine (&#x3b2;-CD-PEI-FA) nanocomposites, based on FA targeted to folate receptors on the surface of macrophages and tumor cells. Both in vivo and in vitro safety evaluations of the nanocarriers were performed, which confirmed the exceptional biocompatibility. Assays involving the coculture of induced nanodrug-loaded macrophages and KSHV-positive cells demonstrated the efficient delivery of miR-34a-5p into KSHV-positive cells through macrophages. This delivery led to the inhibition of the proliferation and cell cycle of cocultured KSHV-positive cells, as well as a significant reduction in the expression of KSHV pathogenic genes RTA and v-GPCR. Notably, fluorescence imaging of organs revealed the in vivo delivery of nanocomposites into brain tissues, including tumors. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry analysis revealed increased macrophages infiltration in both tumors and brain tissues in xenograft mice. In conclusion, our study presents a pioneering strategy employing macrophages as carriers for delivering &#x3b2;-CD-PEI-FA/miR-34a-5p nanocomplexes in anti-KSHV therapy.\n",

            "Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a malignancy associated with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), primarily affecting immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV or those receiving immunosuppressive treatments. Immunocompetent individuals may also be affected, illustrating the disease's heterogeneity. KS manifests in different forms-classic, endemic, epidemic, iatrogenic, and in men having sex with men-each with distinct clinical features depending on immune status and geographic area of origin. Although advances in treatment have improved disease control, effective management remains a challenge. This review focuses on the comprehensive approach to investigating and treating KS. It highlights the role of histology, immunohistochemistry, and staging in diagnosing KS and assessing disease extension, together with other KSHV diseases (multicentric Castelman disease, primary effusion lymphoma, and KS inflammatory cytokine syndrome). Treatment strategies are discussed, with emphasis on restoring immunity in immunocompromised patients, alongside conventional local therapies, and chemotherapy options like liposomal doxorubicin and paclitaxel for aggressive and extensive forms. Promising emerging therapies, including immunomodulatory agents, antiangiogenic therapies, and checkpoint inhibitors, are also explored. The review emphasizes the importance of personalized treatment based on the patient's underlying condition and KS subtype. It provides an in-depth look at the pathogenesis, diagnostic methods, and evolving therapeutic approaches, offering valuable insights into improving management and outcomes for KS patients.\n",

            "This article traces the origins of the present-day association of prostitution and drug addiction in Britain. Through an examination of a variety of political discussions in the 1980s that centred on sex work, drug use, and HIV/AIDS, I locate the emergence of the cultural legitimacy of narratives of addiction within discourses of prostitution. I argue that it was in the 1980s, within the context of the rise of heroin use and the concomitant emergence of AIDS, that the interwoven discourses of drug addiction and prostitution were forged and cemented. Within the context of these two 1980s epidemics, the discrete and intelligible figure of the 'drug-using prostitute' emerged. Public health policy approached sex work within the context of AIDS as inextricably linked to IV drug use both in their policy discussions and policy implementation. Yet, the emergence of the 'drug-using prostitute' also served other political and punitive ends, being used in debates around the criminalization of drug possession and sex work. Overwhelmingly, these political discussions gendered the sex worker and positioned her in opposition to the idealized heterosexual family, necessitating the policing and pathologization of both drug use and sex work. The use of the figure of the drug-using prostitute sits at the convergence of discourses of disease, criminality, publicness, gender, and moral depravity, and thus, this article contributes to the historiography of sex work, drug culture, public health, 'deviance', and Thatcherite Britain.\n",

            "Genome editing offers a great promise to treating human genetic diseases. To assess the genome editing mediated therapeutic effects in vivo, an animal model is indispensable. While, the genomic disparities between mice and humans often impede the direct clinical application of genome editing mediated treatments using conventional mouse models. Thus, the generation of a mouse model with a humanized genomic segment containing a patient-specific mutation is highly sought after for translational research. In this study, we successfully developed a knock-in mouse model for autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), designated as hT17M knock-in, which incorporates a 75-nucleotide DNA segment with the T17M mutation (Rhodopsin-c.C50T; p.T17M). This model demonstrated significant reductions in electroretinogram (ERG) amplitudes and exhibited disruptions in retinal structure. Subsequently, we administered an adeno-associated virus (AAVs) carrying an adenine base editor (ABE) and a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) specifically targeting the T17M mutation, achieving a peak correction rate of 39.7% at the RNA level and significantly improving retinal function in ABE-injected mice. These findings underscore that the hT17M knock-in mouse model recapitulates the clinical features of adRP patients as well as exhibits therapeutic effects with ABE-mediated treatments. It offers a promising avenue for the development of gene-editing therapies for retinitis pigmentosa.\n",

Accurate identification of antibiotic resistant strains is essential for the control of infection. In the present study, our goal is to leverage the whole-genome data of <i>H. pylori</i> to develop practical and interpretable machine learning (ML) models for comprehensive antibiotic resistance assessment. A total of 296 <i>H. pylori</i> isolates with genome-wide data were downloaded from the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases. By training ML models on feature sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms from SNP calling (SNPs-1), antibiotic-resistance SNP annotated by the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (SNPs-2), gene presence or absence (GPA), we generated predictive models for four antibiotics and multidrug-resistance (MDR). Among them, the models that combined SNPs-1, SNPs-2, and GPA data demonstrated the best performance, with the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) consistently outperforming others. And then we utilized the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret the ML models. Furthermore, a free web application for the MDR model was deployed to the GitHub repository (https://H.pylori/MDR/App/). Our study demonstrated the promise of employing whole-genome data in conjunction with ML algorithms to forecast <i>H. pylori</i> antibiotic resistance. In the future, the application of this approach for predicting <i>H. pylori</i> antibiotic resistance would hold the potential to mitigate the empiric administration.\n",

            "Fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) is a non-enveloped double-stranded DNA virus with a 43-45&#xa0;kb genome. This characteristic makes it a promising viral vector for expressing other antigens in developing multi-valent or multi-series vaccines in the poultry industry. To create an easy-to-use reverse genetics system for manipulating FAdV-4 genomic DNA, a full-length infectious clone of FAdV-4 was constructed using lambda Red-mediated recombination in Escherichia coli DH10B. Viable viruses were successfully rescued after the transfection of linearised infectious clones into LMH cells. The rescued viruses showed the same cytopathic effect and growth kinetics as wild-type FAdV-4 viruses. Based on the FAdV-4 infectious clone, the hexon coding sequence of the high-pathogenicity FAdV-4 was replaced by that of the nonpathogenic FAdV-4 using lambda Red-mediated recombination combined with rpsL counter selection without leaving extra sequences after engineering. The rescued recombinant virus was highly attenuated and showed low pathogenicity to 21-day-old SPF chickens. Hereto, the easy-to-use reverse genetics system for FAdV-4 was successfully established. With this platform, the genomic DNA of FAdV-4 can be manipulated and purified in DH10B, making it quicker and easier to generate a recombinant FAdV-4 virus to develop multi-valent/multi-series vaccines.\n",

This cross-sectional observational study describes the physical status according to the short physical performance battery (SPPB) of patients admitted to the hospital setting for COVID-19 and to identify variables potentially related to this outcome. Thirty-six patients admitted to the hospital setting for COVID-19 in the first wave living in the community. Patients were evaluated with the SPPB, strength test, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, the 1-minute sit-to stand, spirometry, the Barthel index, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and other patient-related data were collected. We performed bivariate and regression analyses. A linear regression was fitted, having SPPB as a dependent variable to ascertain the impact of intensive care unit (ICU) admission on physical performance. Five variables were related to SPPB. There was a significant relationship between admission to the ICU and having a heart disease (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.015), the level of physical activity (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.049), number of years smoking (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.029) and days of hospitalization (P&#x2005;=&#x2005;.005).

Medical and paramedical students are more likely to experience exam-related stress and anxiety. Here we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of exam anxiety and its associated risk factors among undergraduate Arab medical and paramedical students. We performed a multi-center cross-sectional study in 6 Arab countries: Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Palestine, Algeria, and Libya from March to April 2021. We used Epi Info version 7.2 software to calculate the sample size. An online questionnaire including The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21) was used to measure exam-related anxiety. A total of 18,979 participants filled out the questionnaire, 71.3% of them were females. The majority of the study participants were between the ages of 20 to 21 years 42.4% (n&#x2005;=&#x2005;8055). On the DASS, 38.8% of participants experienced severe symptoms of depression, 47.6% of them experienced severe symptoms of anxiety, and 30.2% experienced severe symptoms of stress. Of the 3 subscales of the DASS, Females had a significantly higher risk than males of developing Depression, Anxiety, and Stress (B&#x2005;=&#x2005;2.454, P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.001), (B&#x2005;=&#x2005;4.256, P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.001), (B&#x2005;=&#x2005;3.516, P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.001) respectively.

Students who spend 13 to 18 hours a week studying, were considerably more likely to have lower scores on all DASS subscales than those who study more than 18 hours per week, depression (B&#x2005;=&#x2005;-0.983, P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.001), Anxiety (B&#x2005;=&#x2005;-1.334, P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.001) and stress (B&#x2005;=&#x2005;-1.693, P&#x2005;&lt;&#x2005;.001). The prevalence of exam-related anxiety, stress, and depression is high among medical and paramedical students in the Arab region. Medical educators should be aware of the impacts of this comorbidity and should work on implementing new and effective strategies to help students cope with psychological changes during exams. This paper gives a clearer insight into the level of exam anxiety and its predictors, which will enable the responsible authorities to intervene, based on the findings.\n",
            "Proteins of pathogens such as cardioviruses, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus, varicella zoster virus and bacteria of the genus Yersinia were previously shown to use a common \"DDVF\" (D/E-D/E-V-F) short linear motif (SLiM) to hijack cellular kinases of the RSK (p90 ribosomal S6 kinases) family. Notably, the leader (L) protein of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), a cardiovirus, and protein YopM of Yersinia species were shown to act as adapters to retarget RSKs toward unconventional substrates, nucleoporins and pyrin, respectively. Remarkable conservation of the SLiM docking site targeted by pathogens' proteins in RSK sequences suggested a physiological role for this site. Using SLiM prediction tools and AlphaFold docking, we screened the human proteome for proteins that would interact with RSKs through a DDVF-like SLiM. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that two candidates previously known as RSK partners, FGFR1 and SPRED2, as well as two candidates identified as novel RSK partners, GAB3 and CNKSR2 do interact with RSKs through a similar interface as the one used by pathogens, as was recently documented for SPRED2. FGFR1 employs a DSVF motif to bind RSKs and phosphorylation of the serine in this motif slightly increased RSK binding. FGFR1, SPRED2, GAB3 and CNKSR2 act upstream of RSK in the RAS-ERK MAP kinase pathway. Analysis of ERK activation in cells expressing a mutated form of RSK lacking the DDVF-docking site suggests that RSK might interact with the DDVF-like SLiM of several partners to provide a negative feed-back to the ERK MAPK pathway. Moreover, after TMEV infection, ERK phosphorylation was altered by the L protein in a DDVF-dependent manner. Taken together, our data suggest that, in addition to retargeting RSKs toward unconventional substrates, pathogen proteins carrying a DDVF-like motif can compete with endogenous DDVF-containing proteins for RSK binding, thereby altering the regulation of the RAS-ERK MAP kinase pathway.\n",
            "PM2.5 exposure is closely linked to the exacerbation of asthma. Estrogen related receptor gamma (Esrrg), an orphan nuclear receptor, exerts a crucial role as a transcription factor in various metabolic diseases. Nevertheless, the impacts of Esrrg on PM2.5-triggered asthma aggravation have not been investigated. Herein, ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthmatic mice were exposed to PM2.5 to establish a mouse model of asthma aggravation by PM2.5. In view of mRNA sequencing, <i>Esrrg</i> was the only member of nuclear receptor superfamily in the up-regulated differentially expressed genes in OVA compared with Naive groups as well as OVA+PM2.5 compared with OVA groups (|log<sub>2</sub> (fold change)|&gt;1 and p&lt;0.05). <i>In vivo</i>, adeno-associated virus carrying <i>Esrrg</i> shRNA (AAV-shEsrrg) was applied to silencing Esrrg. In addition, Esrrg activity was suppressed pharmacologically with an inverse agonist GSK5182. Either AAV-shEsrrg or GSK5182 ameliorated airway inflammation in the PM2.5-aggravated asthmatic mice. <i>In vitro</i>, isolated mouse primary tracheobronchial epithelial cells (MTEC) from mice were identified by detecting cytokeratin 7-positive cells. The treatment of adenovirus vector with shEsrrg or GSK5182 mitigated the cell damage induced by PM2.5. Notably, phosphodiesterase 3B (Pde3b) expression was declined by Esrrg inhibition <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Dual luciferase reporter and ChIP-PCR assays showed the binding of Esrrg to the Pde3b promoter. Taken together, these results revealed that Esrrg inhibition alleviated airway inflammation in the PM2.5-deteriorated asthmatic mouse model and prevented PM2.5-driven MTEC injury through binding to the <i>Pde3b</i> promoter, which might contribute to further study the therapy of PM2.5-aggravated asthma.\n",
            "Infection with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox and shingles, both manifesting as a blistering skin rash. The skin is central to VZV, as the site of viral replication, transmission from cell-free virus in blisters and as the gateway to sensory nerves for establishing latency. The existing chickenpox vaccine is based on the live attenuated vOka strain and is impaired for replication in skin. While the genetics of the vOka vaccine have been extensively studied, critical gaps exist in understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of vOka attenuation, particularly in human skin models. This review aims to explore the molecular biology of vOka vaccine, focusing on its genetic diversity, interaction with host skin pathways, and the impact of vOka mutations in key VZV genes on attenuation mechanisms in human skin models. Insights from this review may guide the development of next-generation varicella vaccines and enhance the understanding of VZV pathogenesis.\n",
            "Most previously authorized clinical antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have lost neutralizing activity to recent variants due to rapid viral evolution. To mitigate such escape, we preemptively enhance AZD3152, an antibody authorized for prophylaxis in immunocompromised individuals. Using deep mutational scanning (DMS) on the SARS-CoV-2 antigen, we identify AZD3152 vulnerabilities at antigen positions F456 and D420. Through two iterations of computational antibody design that integrates structure-based modeling, machine-learning, and experimental validation, we co-optimize AZD3152 against 24 contemporary and previous SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as 20 potential future escape variants. Our top candidate, 3152-1142, restores full potency (100-fold improvement) against the more recently emerged XBB.1.5+F456L variant that escaped AZD3152, maintains potency against previous variants of concern, and shows no additional vulnerability as assessed by DMS. This preemptive mitigation demonstrates a generalizable approach for optimizing existing antibodies against potential future viral escape.\n",
            "The two influenza B virus (FLUBV) lineages have continuously diverged from each other since the 1980s, with recent (post-2015) viruses exhibiting accelerated evolutionary rates. Emerging data from human studies and epidemiological models suggest that increased divergence in contemporary viruses may drive differential cross-protection, where infection with Yamagata lineage viruses provides limited immunity against Victoria lineage viruses. Here, we developed animal models to investigate the mechanisms behind asymmetric cross-protection between contemporary FLUBV lineages. Our results show that contemporary Victoria immunity provides robust cross-protection against the Yamagata lineage, whereas Yamagata immunity offers limited protection against the Victoria lineage. This differential cross-protection is driven by Victoria-elicited neuraminidase (NA)-specific antibodies, which show cross-lineage reactivity, unlike those from Yamagata infections. These findings identify a phenomenon in contemporary FLUBV that may help explain the recent disappearance of the Yamagata lineage from circulation, highlighting the crucial role of targeting NA in vaccination strategies to enhance cross-lineage FLUBV protection.\n",
            "Dengue, caused by the dengue virus (DENV), presents a significant public health challenge with limited effective treatments. NITD-688 is a potent panserotype DENV inhibitor currently in Phase II clinical trials. However, its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Here, we present the molecular details of how NITD-688 inhibits DENV. NITD-688 binds directly to the nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B) with nanomolar affinities across all four DENV serotypes and specifically disrupts the interaction between NS4B and nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) without significantly changing the interactions between NS4B and other viral or host proteins. NS4B mutations that confer resistance to NITD-688 reduce both NITD-688 binding to NS4B and disruption of the NS4B/NS3 interaction. Specifically, NITD-688 blocks the interaction of NS3 with a cytosolic loop within NS4B. This inhibits the formation of new NS4B/NS3 complexes and disrupts preexisting complexes in vitro and DENV-infected cells, ultimately inhibiting viral replication. Consistent with this mechanism, NITD-688 retains greater potency in cellular assays with delayed treatment compared to JNJ-1802, another NS4B inhibitor that has been studied in Phase II clinical trials. Together, these findings provide critical insights into the mechanism of action of NITD-688, facilitating the development of novel flavivirus NS4B inhibitors and informing future clinical interventions against DENV.\n",
            "Bilirubin metabolism crucially maintains normal liver function, but whether it contributes to antiviral immunity remains unknown. Here, we reveal that the liver bilirubin metabolic pathway facilitates antiviral innate immunity of the body. We discovered that viral infection upregulates uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) expression in the liver, which in turn stabilizes IRF3 proteins to promote type I interferon (IFN-I) production. Moreover, we found that serum unconjugated bilirubin (UCB), a unique physiological substrate of UGT1A1, can competitively inhibit the binding of IFN-I to IFN-I receptor 2 (IFNAR2), thus attenuating IFN-I-induced antiviral signaling of the body. Accordingly, effective bilirubin metabolism in the liver promotes antiviral immunity of the body by specifically employing liver UGT1A1-mediated enhancement of IFN-I production and reducing serum bilirubin-mediated inhibition of IFN-I signaling. This study uncovers the significance of bilirubin metabolism in antiviral innate immunity and demonstrates that conventional IFN-I therapy is less efficient for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) with high levels of bilirubin.\n",
            "Recently, episodes of exanthema subitum (ES) have been occurring later than expected in Japanese patients, though the effects of this delayed timing remain unclear. Therefore, this study examined the association between ES timing and febrile seizure (FS) in Japanese children. Information on the diagnoses of ES and FS was obtained from the Japan Environment and Children's Study, a nationwide prospective birth cohort study including 97,410 mothers and their children. Two groups were created: early ES (first ES episode between birth and 11 months of age) and late ES (first ES episode between 12 and 23 months of age) groups. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to compare the cumulative incidence rate of FS between the groups. Moreover, because a single episode of fever implies that the ES and FS occurred simultaneously, we examined the association between the ES timing and the simultaneous co-occurrence of FS with ES in a limited cohort with one fever episode until the age of 24 months. In total, 27,238 full-term children were included, with 12,565 (46.1%) in the early ES group and 14,673 (53.9%) in the late ES group. Late ES was estimated to increase the cumulative incidence risk of FS until the age of 24 months (adjusted odds ratio 1.46; 95% confidence interval [1.32-1.61]) and 48 months (1.26 [1.15-1.37]). The limited cohort included 1,022 children, and late ES was estimated to increase the risk of FS with ES (4.39 [1.48-13.02]). Late ES is estimated to increase the risk of FS. Further basic research and cohort studies, including virological examinations, are required to elucidate the pathogenesis of ES with FS.\n",
            "During the COVID-19 pandemic, effective crisis communication has been crucial yet challenging, especially for culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities. This study explored how CALD Asian communities in New Zealand accessed and trusted various sources of COVID-19 information. A cross-sectional online survey with 1,267 Asian respondents was conducted in 2021. Findings revealed that participants engaged with diverse sources for COVID-19 information, despite delays in government efforts to provide linguistically appropriate information. Those without English as a first language tended to have access to fewer information sources. Ethnic group preferences varied: Indian and South East Asian groups favoured official channels (mainstream media and government websites), the Chinese group preferred messaging applications and workplaces, and the Korean group showed a preference for ethnic community media. Trust was higher in formal information sources than online platforms and personal networks. Increased trust was noted in social media among non-English speakers and messaging applications among Koreans, while decreased trust was seen in messaging applications among Chinese and workplace information among Koreans. This research underscores the necessity of multifaceted, linguistically, and culturally appropriate crisis communication strategies. It advocates for proactive measures to establish networks for distributing vital information to CALD communities during future crisis communication.\n",
            "Ebola virus (EBOV) is a filovirus that causes severe hemorrhagic fever and has a fatality rate between 50 and 90%. The vaccines were developed against the Ebola Zaire species; therefore, it is necessary to develop vaccines against other species to control future outbreaks. The objective of this work was to obtain vaccine candidate peptides against different EBOV species through the use of bioinformatics programs and servers that allow glycoprotein (GP) to be analyzed. GP sequences of various EBOV species that did not present gaps or unspecified amino acids or that were repeated (same year, region and laboratory) were downloaded from the NCBI database. A consensus sequence was generated and used to determine vaccine candidate peptides, which were evaluated, through a combination of servers and molecular dynamics, for their ability to interact with B and T lymphocytes, toxicity, allergenicity, solvent exposure, glycosylation, antigenicity, and presence in mature GP. Five vaccine candidate peptides were identified, of which PEP4 had the best characteristics evaluated in this study. PEP4 may be a potential candidate for the development of an EBOV vaccine.\n",
            "Identification and characterization of antibody epitope targets on the hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope proteins remain crucial for developing an effective vaccine. Building on prior research defining E1/E2 antibody epitope clustering, we screened a phage display library derived from a chronic HCV patient against detergent-extracted full-length E1/E2 from both the patient's acute-phase isolate (H77, genotype 1a) and a heterologous isolate (S52, genotype 3a). This approach yielded a panel of VH1-69 derived antibody fragments (Fabs) with similar characteristics. Interestingly, all members of the panel exhibited blocking activity against both antigenic region 2 and 3 (AR2 and AR3) in competition ELISAs, which contrasts with the behavior of most previously identified AR3-targeting antibodies. The VH1-69 derived binders had a high affinity for soluble E2 in both Fab and IgG formats, with dissociation constants in the low picomolar range. These Fab binders were broadly neutralizing against a panel of HCV cell culture viruses of genotype 1-6 with higher potency than the well-characterized reference Fab, AR3A. However, in the IgG format the antibodies had similar potency. These findings expand our understanding of potential targets for vaccine development by characterizing a panel of antibodies targeting an AR3 epitope also involving or occluding the back layer of E2. The broad neutralization and high affinity of these antibodies suggest a benefit to targeting both the back layer and the front layer of E2 in HCV vaccine designs to expand the repertoire of broadly neutralizing antibodies, thereby offering promise for the development of more effective preventive measures against this pervasive human pathogen.\n",
            "Black girls are disproportionately impacted by HIV and STIs in the United States. Black male caregivers are underutilized in family-based HIV/STI prevention programming and offer a novel opportunity to protect Black girls. This study will evaluate the efficacy and implementation of an HIV/STI prevention program delivered to Black girls and male caregivers in community settings. IMAGE: IMARA for the Male Caregivers and Girls Empowerment was adapted from IMARA, an evidence-based mother-daughter intervention to decrease HIV/STI infection and increase communication and healthy relationships among girls and their male caregivers. Using an efficacy implementation design, we will test the effectiveness of IMAGE compared to a time-matched general health promotion program across six community-based organizations. Aim one will evaluate IMAGE in a 2-arm randomized controlled trial with 300 14-18-year-old Black girls and their male caregiver dyads in Chicago, IL. We hypothesize that girls who receive IMAGE will have lower STI incidence (primary outcome), fewer sexual partners, and more consistent condom use (secondary outcomes) at 6- and 12-months compared to girls in the health promotion program. Guided by the 3-Step Implementation Model, our second aim is to identify and describe factors (barriers, facilitators) and processes affecting implementation in community settings. HIV and STI disparities go beyond individual-level factors, and male caregivers may protect girls by being a sexual health resource. This study will facilitate rapid CBO uptake and ownership of IMAGE if effective. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06266416.\n",
            "PurposeThis study aimed to identify the perceptions of pediatric physical therapists, identifying barriers and facilitators to providing telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsUsing a mixed methods design, an online, national survey gathered demographics and participants' perceptions.ResultsA total of 165 pediatric physical therapists participated in the study. Sixty-four percent of respondents rated their pre-pandemic perception of telehealth services as \"somewhat\" to \"very\" negative. After utilizing telehealth, 66% of therapists reported perceptions of telehealth as \"somewhat\" or \"very\" positive. Barriers were 1) poor patient and parent participation and 2) technology issues. Facilitators were 1) hands-on involvement, 2) ability to share information, and 3) ability to use items in the home. Predominate themes to open-ended responses further elucidated pre- and post-pandemic telehealth perceptions.ConclusionAfter implementing telehealth services during COVID- 19, most therapists indicated their perceptions of telehealth were somewhat or very positive.\n",
            "The life-threatening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects about 1 in 1,000 healthy people under 50 without underlying conditions. Among patients with&#xa0;critical COVID-19 pneumonia, rare germline variants at genes controlling type I IFN immunity have been reported in up to 5% of patients. Causal etiologies in 80-85% of cases are still unknown. We analyzed two families with hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia for known single-gene inborn errors of immunity. In Family 1, two siblings with critical COVID-19 were homozygous for a DOCK2 variant, c.3624+5G&gt;A. DOCK2 deficiency is a known T-cell disorder underlying severe viral diseases. The variant resulted in skipping exon 35, which was predicted to produce a frameshift truncated protein (p.L1157Ifs*12). The proband showed markedly decreased blood CD4 T-helper cell counts, impaired T lymphocyte transformation test, and increased serum IgG, IgA, and IgE levels, as documented in other DOCK2-deficient patients. In Family 2, the proband had lethal COVID-19 and HPV-2-associated multiple recalcitrant warts. She was heterozygous for a deletion in GATA2:c.1075_1102del28, p.W360Sfs*18. GATA2 haploinsufficiency is a known cause of severe viral diseases due to a lack of plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) development. The proband had monocytopenia and a lack of circulating pDCs, as reported in other patients with GATA2 haploinsufficiency. Overall, both DOCK2 deficiency and GATA2 haploinsufficiency are associated with&#xa0;critical and often fatal COVID-19 pneumonia.\n",
            "In this study, systemic and localized immunity induced by SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern or interest (VOC/VOI) was investigated. For that, serum and tracheal aspirate soluble chemokines, pro-inflammatory/regulatory cytokines, and growth factors were measured in severe COVID-19 patients under mechanical ventilation upon infection with different SARS-CoV-2 variants, namely Alpha, Gamma, Zeta, Delta and Omicron. Increased levels of soluble mediators were observed in serum from severe COVID-19 patients regardless of the variant. In tracheal aspirate samples, the patients infected with the Gamma, Zeta, Delta, and Omicron variants exhibited reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines when compared to those infected with the Alpha variant. The trend of lower cytokine levels was also observed in the serum of patients across these variants, except for the Delta variant. By using network analysis and cytokine storm signatures, the data confirmed that severe COVID-19 induced by different variants have a completely divergent pattern of connectivity in serum samples as well as tracheal aspirates. Patients infected with variants at later time points in the pandemic such as Omicron exhibited networks of weak central architecture in serum samples as compared to tracheal aspirates, with lower number of neighborhood connections and clusters of pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines. By and large, this study points out to important systemic and local divergences and to loss of airway localized immunity in severe COVID-19 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants, which brings insight into understanding host responses and viral escape vis-&#xe0;-vis the virus mutations and evolution.\n",
            "Introduction There is increasing concern about the wellbeing of tertiary students, and this is likely to be further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is minimal information about what support is being provided. In New Zealand, there is even less information available on Pacific students in the tertiary environment. Aim This study explored the role of one tertiary institution in the provision of support for Pacific tertiary students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Pacific students' perceptions of all the support they received from the University of Otago during the COVID-19 pandemic were obtained from a cross-sectional survey between April to June 2022. All Pacific students attending the University in 2022 were eligible to participate. An online survey was emailed to all students. Results There were 1277 Pacific students enrolled at the University in 2022. Of all eligible Pacific students, 358 (28%) completed the survey. Three quarters of students had to isolate since the start of the academic year, either because they had COVID-19, or they were a close contact of someone with the disease. Of all participants, 356 (99%) received a health pack. At least two-thirds (67.6%) had accessed other support from the University. A third (32.4%) accessed support through the Otago University Students' Association and some from the community and local Pacific health provider. The support was highly valued by students who utilised these services. Discussion Institutions can provide effective leadership in the coordination of support for their students through working together with student-led, government and non-governmental organisations in the community.\n",
            "Introduction Client-Led Integrated Care (CLIC) was implemented in general practices between 2018 and 2022 in the Southern region of New Zealand. It was envisaged to be an equitable, holistic and patient-centred inter-disciplinary framework of care for those with multiple long-term conditions; usually called multimorbidity. Aim This process evaluation aimed to determine whether CLIC supported self-management ability and assessed its alignment with current priorities for multimorbidity management. Method Mixed methods were used across four purposively selected general practices. At each practice interviews were undertaken together with participant observation over 3years. This was followed by analysis of annual self-report surveys. Results CLIC worked well for those patients who were engaged, but the implementation provided minimal consideration of the resources required for everyone to receive culturally competent integrated care. Staff reported structural difficulties and wondered if the right patients were targeted. Discussion CLIC did not address the needs of all participants, nor did it target those with the most ability to benefit. In all practices, despite increasing rates of multimorbidity and social complexity during a pandemic, the organisation of general practice and how it connected with the health system remained unchanged. Transitioning to a general practice system for complex multimorbidity will require changes in funding, strong leadership and clear communication. It requires all areas of the health system to provide an integrated health and social care system that is culturally competent and engages those most vulnerable in our community.\n",
            "External resources, defined as commercial learning resources typically found online and not created by academic institutions, are increasingly utilized by students in medical education. As the use of external resources continues to grow, there is a need to understand their appropriate place within medical education and for faculty members to continue to integrate such resources into the existing medical curricula. A gap in the literature exists regarding the role of such resources within formal medical education. This narrative review identifies factors contributing to the use of external resources, integrates student and faculty perspectives to highlight their unique insights, and collaboratively proposes recommendations for the future use of external resources in medical education. Identified factors contributing to the increased use of external resources include generational affinity for technology and online learning, perceived efficiency compared to live lectures, pass-fail grading system of biomedical science courses, the pressure of board exams, and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although external resources are expensive, medical students use them to support their pre-clerkship learning and performance on national licensure exams. Faculty share the goal of student success and see potential for integration of external resources in the curriculum but raise concerns about reduced learner presence and willingness to read as well as the possibility of a universal medical curriculum. Collaborative student-faculty recommendations include the primacy of student autonomy, the benefits of classroom engagement, and the importance of cost management around third-party resources. Although external resources should not supplant all faculty instruction, they can benefit both medical students and faculty when thoughtfully and strategically integrated within the pre-clerkship curriculum to enhance learning outcomes and board exam performance.\n",
            "An estimated 10-20 million people worldwide are infected with the deltaretrovirus human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Although most infected individuals remain asymptomatic, some progress to develop the fatal and debilitating disease adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) or HTLV-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) or develop a plethora of other inflammatory disorders. In addition, HTLV-1 infection is associated with immunosuppression and a shorter lifespan. Although a protective role for neutralizing antibodies has been suggested, the role of non-neutralizing antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) remains unclear, largely because an assay to measure this response has not been established. Here, we developed a high-throughput flow cytometry-based assay system to measure HTLV-1 envelope-specific ADCC. We used a natural killer cell-resistant T-lymphoblastoid cell line stably expressing the green fluorescent protein GFP to construct a target cell line expressing HTLV-1 envelope protein and using monoclonal antibodies and plasma samples from HTLV-infected or uninfected individuals, validating the specificity and sensitivity of the assay. We detected high ADCC activity in samples from HTLV-1-infected humans. In the plasma of experimentally infected macaques, ADCC activity was measured and a correlation between ADCC activity and HTLV-1 envelope antibody titers was observed. Further, we observed a significant increase in ADCC titer over time; as HTLV-1 infection persists, a higher ADCC response is generated, potentially influencing disease outcome. ADCC titer in HTLV-1-infected macaques also positively correlated with FLT3LG, IL-17F, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and lymphocytes but negatively correlated with monocyte frequency and classical monocyte frequency. In conclusion, these findings detail the generation of a cell line that enabled development of an HTLV-specific ADCC assay, which can be employed in large clinical studies as well as research involving humans or non-human primates.IMPORTANCEThis approach measures human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-specific envelope antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity responses, provides a critical tool to investigate the role of envelope-specific binding antibodies in the immune control of HTLV infection and pathogenesis, and may help guide the development of both therapeutic and preventative vaccine approaches.\n",
            "While vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains crucial, neurological complications have been detected following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. The neurological complications of COVID-19 vaccination can be seen in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). In this study, we reviewed PNS complications after COVID-19 vaccination, their underlying mechanisms, diagnosis, and management. Inflammatory polyneuropathy, small fiber neuropathy, Parsonage-Turner syndrome (PTS), cranial mononeuropathies, and myasthenia gravis (MG) have been reported following COVID-19 vaccination. Inflammatory polyneuropathy following COVID-19 vaccination should be diagnosed early based on clinical presentation and treated with supportive care, and immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis to prevent respiratory distress if required. It is important to differentiate peripheral from central facial paralysis after COVID-19 vaccination to rule out upper motor neuron damage, including stroke. Diagnosis of small fiber neuropathy in the setting of COVID-19 vaccination should be suspected in patients with dysesthesia, dysautonomia, and lower extremity paresthesia. A skin biopsy of the proximal or distal lower limb should generally be considered for diagnosing small fiber neuropathy following COVID-19 vaccination. Even though pain at the injection site is one of the most common symptoms after COVID-19 vaccination, shoulder pain lasting more than 3 weeks should raise the suspicion of severe complications such as PTS. In addition to a proper physical examination as a reliable diagnosis tool, needle electromyography can be considered to help the diagnosis of PTS following COVID-19 vaccination. In our opinion, despite complications after COVID-19 vaccination, the benefit of vaccination immunity should not be forgotten.\n",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic presents several challenges during pregnancy including thromboembolic complications, direct placental infection, transplacental transmission, and systemic hyperinflammatory state. The liver is the second most commonly affected organ in SARS-CoV-2 infection after the lungs. Mechanisms of liver injury in COVID-19 patients can include: direct viral cytopathic effect, worsening of underlying liver disease, cytokine storm, hypoxic ischemic injury, and cholangiopathy leading to persistent marked cholestasis. Here we describe 3 infants at Texas Children's Hospital with perinatal SARS-CoV-2 exposure with persistent cholestasis and histologic evidence of extrahepatic biliary obstruction suggesting underlying biliary atresia (BA) with some atypical features possibly exacerbated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. All 3 patients described in this case series developed liver failure in the setting of low GGT cholestasis, and all 3 required liver transplantation within the first year of life. Though post-COVID cholangiopathy is described in adults in the literature, none of the infants in our series had moderate or severe COVID infection but still progressed to advanced liver disease. Instead it is very likely that the patients in our series had underlying BA with some atypical features, with the commonality of having been exposed perinatally to SARS-CoV-2 Though further studies are needed to determine causality, our case series raises the question of if the timing of exposure/infection plays a role in prognosis.\n",
            "Purpose of the researchA major consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic was a disruption of medical care in the United States. Using cross-sectional data from an ongoing randomized clinical trial, we examined severity of COVID-related hardships and other factors that might have influenced newly diagnosed people with HIV's (PWH's) receipt of care during the initial years of the pandemic (2020-22).Major findingsIn a sample of 29 newly diagnosed PWH presenting for care at three geographically diverse medical clinics in the United States, results showed that most patients (72.4%) reported that obtaining an HIV medical appointment during the pandemic was \"easy.\" Correlational analyses found that COVID-related hardships were significantly related to overall health and functioning, as well as experiences of discrimination.ConclusionsTaken together, these findings align with previous results to show that already vulnerable populations were particularly affected by service disruptions, but that many patients were able to access care despite the pandemic.\n",
            "BackgroundMonkeypox (mpox) is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by the mpox virus and characterized by painful body lesions, fever, headaches, and exhaustion. Since the report of the first human case of mpox in Africa, there have been multiple outbreaks, even in nonendemic regions of the world. The emergence and re-emergence of mpox highlight the critical need for early detection, which has spurred research into applying deep learning to improve diagnostic capabilities.ObjectiveThis research aims to develop a robust hybrid long short-term memory (LSTM)-convolutional neural network (CNN) model with a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to provide a potential tool for the early detection of mpox.MethodsA hybrid LSTM-CNN multi-stream deep learning model with CBAM was developed and trained using the Mpox Skin Lesion Dataset Version 2.0 (MSLD v2.0). We employed LSTM layers for preliminary feature extraction, CNN layers for further feature extraction, and CBAM for feature conditioning. The model was evaluated with standard metrics, and gradient-weighted class activation maps (Grad-CAM) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) were used for interpretability.ResultsThe model achieved an F1-score, recall, and precision of 94%, an area under the curve of 95.04%, and an accuracy of 94%, demonstrating competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art models. This robust performance highlights the reliability of our model. LIME and Grad-CAM offered insights into the model's decision-making process.ConclusionThe hybrid LSTM-CNN multi-stream deep learning model with CBAM successfully detects mpox, providing a promising early detection tool that can be integrated into web and mobile platforms for convenient and widespread use.\n",
            "Pathogenic viruses are globally distributed and have caused severe diseases or death in wildlife populations, posing enormous threats to wild animals, especially threatened species. The transmission dynamics of pathogenic viral diseases are affected by complex factors and their interactions, such as climate, virus traits, host life-history traits, and environmental conditions. The seroprevalence of viruses can reflect the historical exposure of hosts to viruses and may indicate accumulated pathogenic viral disease severity in wildlife populations. We studied viruses with demonstrated virulence that have caused diseases or death in their natural hosts among wild terrestrial mammals. We extracted data on virus traits, host species, host life-history traits, and climate conditions from the peer-reviewed literature to explore their effects on and interactions with virus seroprevalence in wildlife populations. Ungulates were the most studied group followed by carnivores. The seroprevalence of pathogenic viruses was positively correlated with temperature in wildlife populations. The correlation between precipitation and virus seroprevalence was complicated and depended on different interactions of variables. Gregarious animals and nonmigratory ungulates were more vulnerable to high viral seroprevalence than other species. As global temperatures increase, drought will increase, and gregarious and nonmigratory ungulates may thus experience increased spread and incidence of pathogenic viruses, especially vector-borne viruses. Gregarious carnivores may face a high risk of outbreaks of viruses that are transmitted directly (e.g., canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus, and rabies virus). Our results can be used to inform protocols for surveillance of specific viruses and susceptible host life-history traits to prevent epizootics in natural populations, which will be crucial for the conservation of terrestrial mammals under global climate change.\n",
            "BackgroundThis study assessed the acceptability, among caregivers, of a mental health chatbot designed for adolescents living with HIV aged 10 to 19 years.MethodsFifteen caregivers interacted with the mental health chatbot. Pre-post assessments and semistructured interviews evaluated acceptability. Data were analyzed using a Framework Analysis approach.ResultsCaregivers aged 31 to 70 years found the chatbot acceptable on individual, interpersonal, and environmental levels. They appreciated the educational content and self-help tools, feeling the chatbot would benefit them personally. Caregivers also saw potential in the chatbot to improve communication with their children, particularly during critical periods like HIV diagnosis. Despite concerns about data costs or internet access, most viewed the chatbot as an accessible supplement to traditional mental health services.ConclusionThis study suggests that a mental health chatbot for Peruvian adolescents living with HIV was acceptable to their caregivers, potentially benefiting caregivers' mental health, enhancing caregiver-adolescent interactions, and fostering better communication.\n",
            "Cyanobacteria are intricately linked with its microbiome through multiple metabolic interactions. We assessed how these interactions might be affected by cyanophage infection and lysis in cyanobacterium Nodularia spumigena. The genome-scale metabolic models and analysis of putative metabolic interactions revealed a bidirectional cross-feeding potential within the N. spumigena microbiome, with heterotrophic bacteria exhibiting a greater level of trophic dependency on the cyanobacterium. Our results indicate that microbes associated with N. spumigena rely on the supply of various amino acids, reduced carbon compounds and protein synthesis cofactors released by the cyanobacterial host. We observed that compositional changes in the N. spumigena microbiome were associated with the multiplicity of infection and increased with increasing initial viral load. Higher mortality of N. spumigena led to decreased variability in the relative abundances of bacteria, suggesting an indirect restriction of their niche space. Lysis of N. spumigena resulted in a substantial decline in the estimated absolute abundances of heterotrophic bacteria, indicating reduced fitness of co-occurring bacteria in the absence of N. spumigena. Altogether, we demonstrate how a gradual increase in viral pressure on the photosynthetic host propagates through the co-occurring microbial community, disrupting cooperative nature and microbial connectivity within the N. spumigena microbiome.\n",
            "Fulminant myocarditis is a severe form of acute myocarditis, characterized by complications such as hemodynamic compromise, often requiring advanced mechanical support. It can occur as a result of infection, toxin exposure, or autoimmune processes.&#xa0;This is a case of a 53-year-old male with no past medical history who presented with one week of fever, shortness of breath, and upper respiratory symptoms and subsequently developed fulminant myocarditis, characterized by severe left ventricular dysfunction and cardiogenic shock requiring both inotropic and advanced mechanical support. Initial serological diagnostics were negative for a viral etiology; however, repeat testing, prompted by continued high clinical suspicion, subsequently yielded a positive <i>Coxsackie B</i> viral titer. The diagnosis of myocarditis was further supported by the specific distribution of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on cardiac MRI.&#xa0;We describe the nuanced management approach, including heart failure guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), high-dose steroids, and intravenous immunoglobulins. Additionally, we highlight the role of noninvasive diagnostics and the challenges in targeted management of fulminant myocarditis.\n",
            "Cancer drug resistance has emerged as a formidable challenge in the field of clinical oncology, significantly hampering the success of treatment strategies and leading to suboptimal outcomes for patients. In a broad array of therapeutic settings, the emergence of resistance has become a primary source of concern, ranging from conventional chemotherapy to modern immunotherapy and targeted therapies. The complexity of cancer drug resistance is further exacerbated by the involvement of oncoviruses, such as human papillomavirus (HPV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV), which play pivotal roles in the initiation, progression, and response to treatment of various cancers. The intricate interactions between these oncoviruses and cancer cells have been found to significantly influence drug efficacy. These viruses can alter critical cellular pathways, including drug metabolism, DNA repair mechanisms, and the tumor microenvironment, thus promoting drug resistance. A profound understanding of these virus-cancer-drug interactions is crucial for the development of novel treatment approaches that can effectively overcome drug resistance. This review aimed to contribute to a broader awareness of the multifaceted nature of cancer drug resistance, particularly in the context of oncovirus involvement. By highlighting the critical role of oncoviruses in cancer development and treatment response, this review hopes to stimulate further research and the development of novel treatment strategies that can effectively overcome drug resistance and ultimately improve patient outcomes. As we advance toward precision oncology, a more holistic understanding of the complex interplay among cancer, its associated viruses, and therapeutic drugs is crucial for achieving optimal therapeutic responses.\n",

            "Influenza A virus (IAV) represents a considerable threat to both animal and human health, while current detection methods encounter challenges related to the spectrum, rapidity, and sensitivity of viral identification. Herein, we describe the development of a magnetic T4 phage surface plasmon resonance probe for universal, rapid, highly sensitive, and visually detectable IAV detection under dark field microscopy (DFM). Briefly, we initially fused the Soc protein of the T4 phage with a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody that exhibits broad-spectrum affinity toward the hemagglutinins of group 1 and group 2 influenza viruses, resulting in the generation of the recombinant Soc-scFv protein. Additionally, we generated another recombinant protein called AviTag-Hoc by fusing the Hoc capsid protein of T4 phage with biotin receptor peptides (AviTag). These two recombinant proteins were assembled on the head region of the T4 phage lacking both Soc and Hoc proteins. Subsequently, the resulting assembly was covalently modified with biotin using biotin-protein ligase, enabling conjugation with streptavidin-modified magnetic nanoparticles (SA@MNPs) to generate the magnetic T4 phage probe (T4@scFv@MNPs). Binding experiments demonstrated that this magnetic phage probe specifically binds to a wide range of IAVs of group 1 and group 2. Furthermore, in the presence of influenza viruses, the magnetic T4 phage probe and antibodies functionalized chip can form a sandwich complex that appears as a distinct bright golden yellow fluorescence spot visible to the naked eye under DFM. The number of viruses in samples can be automatically counted using artificial intelligence-assisted software. Assay results from both pure and real virus samples show that our magnetic phage-based DFM strategy is highly time efficient, taking approximately 30 min to complete. The method also showed excellent virus binding efficiency (&gt;85%) in both high and low concentration samples and an extremely low detection limit (1 PFU/&#x3bc;L).\n",
            "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) believed to be driven by autoimmune mechanisms. Genetic and environmental factors are implicated in MS development, and among the latter, diets and nutrients are emerging as potential critical contributors. However, a comprehensive understanding of their impacts and the underlying mechanisms involved is lacking. Harnessing state-of-the-art nutritional geometry analytical methods, it is first revealed that globally, increased carbohydrate supply is associated with increased MS disease burden, while fat supply has an opposite effect. Furthermore, in a MS mouse model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), it is found that an isocaloric diet high in carbohydrate aggravated EAE, while a diet enriched in fat (HF) is fully protective. This is reflected by reduced neuroinflammation and skewing toward anti-inflammatory phenotypes. The protective effects from the HF diet are multifaceted. Metabolically, HF increased lipid storage in immune cells, correlating with their increased anti-inflammatory IL-10 production. Transcriptionally and epigenetically, HF feeding preprogrammed na&#xef;ve T cells toward a less activated but more tolerogenic phenotype. It is showcased that manipulating diets is a potentially efficient and cost-effective approach to prevent and/or ameliorate EAE. This exhibits translational potentials for prevention/intervention of MS and possibly other autoimmune diseases.\n",
            "<b>Background:</b> The MeMed BV<sup>&#xae;</sup> BV score is a novel, promising host-protein score, differentiating bacterial from viral infections, that combines the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), interferon gamma-induced protein-10 (IP-10), and C-reactive protein (CRP). The aim of our study was to determine its diagnostic accuracy in hospitalized febrile children. <b>Methods:</b> A prospective study was performed from December 2023 to April 2024 in two pediatric clinics at \"Aghia Sophia\" Children's Hospital, Athens, Greece. Patients &gt; 3 months old, presenting with fever, clinical suspicion of acute infection, and symptoms onset up to 7 days prior were considered eligible. Patients with cancer, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Tuberculosis (TB), and immunodeficiency were excluded. Two pediatricians reviewed the clinical, laboratory, microbiological, and radiological data and assigned the final diagnosis. The experts were blinded to the BV scores. <b>Results:</b> One hundred and thirty-five patients were enrolled. The predominant medical condition was respiratory tract infection (59.3% lower, 26.7% upper). Twenty-nine (21.5%) patients were diagnosed with bacterial infections. The BV score demonstrated a sensitivity of 96.2%, specificity of 88.7%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 98.9% for bacterial infections. Equivocal BV scores were reported in 8.9% of cases and were excluded from calculations. The area under the curve was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93-0.99). A ROC curve analysis was performed, and the optimal cut-off score was estimated at 60, providing a sensitivity of 93.1%, specificity of 88.7%, and NPV of 97.9%. <b>Conclusions:</b> In our study population, the BV score showed high sensitivity and NPV in bacterial infection diagnosis. Further studies are needed to assess the possibility of replacing the \"equivocal\" range with a narrower one or a specific cut-off value.\n",
            "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Since its emergence in 2020, researchers worldwide have been collaborating to better understand the SARS-CoV-2 disease's pathophysiology. Disease severity can vary based on several factors, including comorbidities and genetic variations. Notably, recent studies have highlighted the role of genes associated with athletic performance, such as ACE, ACTN3, and PPARGC1A, in influencing muscle function, cardiovascular health, and the body's metabolic response. Given that these genes also impact oxidative metabolism, inflammation, and respiratory efficiency, we hypothesized that they might play a critical role in the host's response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study aimed to investigate the association between disease severity and genetic polymorphisms in these sport performance-related genes, specifically ACE rs4646994, ACTN3 rs1815739, and PPARGC1A rs8192678. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 422 COVID-19-positive patients were included in this study. The participants were divided into three groups: a severe group (77 patients) requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, a mild group (300 patients) exhibiting at least one symptom, and an asymptomatic control group. Genotyping was performed using restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR. <b>Results:</b> The D allele and DD genotype of ACE and the T allele and TT genotype of ACTN3 were found to confer protective effects against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conversely, the PPARGC1A TC genotype and the ACE-PPARGC1A ins/ins + TC combined genotype were associated with increased disease severity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> Although vaccination has reduced the severity of SARS-CoV-2, the virus continues to impact human health. Inter-individual differences due to these genetic variations will broaden the horizon of knowledge on the pathophysiology of the disease.\n",
            "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a causative reagent that frequently causes progressive liver diseases, leading to the development of acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite several antiviral drugs, including interferon-<i>&#x3b1;</i> and nucleotide derivatives, being approved for clinical treatment of HBV, critical issues remain unresolved, e.g., their low-to-moderate efficacy and adverse side effects, as well as resistant strains. In this study, twenty-three matrine derivatives were synthesized, and their antiviral effects against HBV were evaluated. Of these, eleven compounds inhibited HBeAg secretion significantly more than the positive control, lamivudine (3TC). Among the compounds synthesized in this study, compounds <b>4a</b> and <b>4d</b> had the most potent inhibitory activity, with IC<sub>50</sub> value of 41.78 and 33.68 &#x3bc;M, respectively. Compounds <b>1h</b>, <b>4a,</b> and <b>4d</b> were also subjected to molecular docking studies. These compounds inhibited viral gene expression and viral propagation in a cell culture model. Thus, we believe our compounds could serve as resource for antiviral drug development.\n",
            "Activated immune cells are highly susceptible to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Vitamin D (VitD) induces antimicrobial responses and reduces cellular activation. We investigated VitD effects on HIV-1 replication, glucose uptake, and gene regulation using computational and in vitro approaches. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from healthy male donors were treated with VitD and infected with HIV-1. After 72 h, p24 protein was measured to assess viral replication. VitD effects on anti- and pro-HIV genes were analyzed by a Boolean network model based on curated databases and the literature. CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptor expression, AKT phosphorylation, and glucose uptake were evaluated by flow cytometry, and expression of some model-identified genes was quantified by qPCR. VitD reduced p24 by 53.2% (<i>p</i> = 0.0078). Boolean network modeling predicted that VitD upregulates antiviral, migration, and cell-differentiation related genes, while downregulating genes related to cellular activation, proliferation, glucose metabolism, and HIV replication, notably <i>AKT1, CCNT1, SLC2A1, HIF1A,</i> and <i>PFKL</i>. In vitro, VitD reduced AKT phosphorylation by 26.6% (<i>p</i> = 0.0156), transcription of <i>CCNT1</i> by 22.7% (<i>p</i> = 0.0391), and glucose uptake by 22.8% (<i>p</i> = 0.0039) without affecting classic antiviral genes or coreceptor expression. These findings suggest an anti-HIV effect of VitD, mediated through AKT and glucose metabolism downmodulation, both involved in cell activation and HIV-1 replication.\n",
            "People with HIV (PWH) have a high risk of peripheral artery disease (PAD), and high-sensitivity troponin (hsTnT) and NT-pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) may be useful biomarkers for PAD in PWH. We assessed associations between hsTnT and NT-proBNP and both prevalent PAD and de novo PAD. Adult PWH were examined at baseline and after 2 years. Inclusion criteria were (1) measurements of hsTnT and NT-proBNP at baseline and (2) ankle brachial index (ABI) at baseline for prevalent PAD and both visits for de novo PAD. PAD was defined as ABI &#x2264; 0.9. We included 1011 PWH, and 88 (8.7%) had PAD at baseline. Among 802 PWH, 29 (3.6%) had de novo PAD at follow-up. A doubling in hsTnT concentration was associated with prevalent PAD with an OR 1.41 (95% CI: 1.02-1.96, <i>p</i> = 0.04) and 1.40 (95% CI: 0.99-1.98, <i>p</i> = 0.055) in a base model and an adjusted model, respectively. High hsTnT was associated with a risk ratio of 3.39 (95% CI: 1.24-9.27, <i>p</i> = 0.02) for de novo PAD in an unadjusted model and 3.44 (95% CI: 0.98-12.10, <i>p</i> = 0.05) after adjustments. NT-proBNP was not associated with PAD. Thus, hsTnT was associated with higher odds of prevalent PAD and increased risk of de novo PAD.\n",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact, with more than 7 million deaths worldwide. Advanced age and comorbidities partially explain severe cases of the disease, but genetic factors also play a significant role. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been instrumental in identifying loci associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we report the results from a &gt;820 K variant GWAS in a COVID-19 patient cohort from the hospitals associated with IIS Biobizkaia. We compared intensive care unit (ICU)-hospitalized patients with non-ICU-hospitalized patients. The GWAS was complemented with an integrated phenotype and genetic modeling analysis using HLA genotypes, a previously identified COVID-19 polygenic risk score (PRS) and clinical data. We identified four variants associated with COVID-19 severity with genome-wide significance (rs58027632 in KIF19; rs736962 in HTRA1; rs77927946 in DMBT1; and rs115020813 in LINC01283). In addition, we designed a multivariate predictive model including HLA, PRS and clinical data which displayed an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.79. Our results combining human genetic information with clinical data may help to improve risk assessment for the development of a severe outcome of COVID-19.\n",
            "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can effectively suppress the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but it cannot completely eradicate the virus. The persistent existence of the HIV reservoir is a major obstacle in the quest for a cure. To date, there have been a total of seven cured cases of HIV worldwide. These patients all cleared HIV while undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for hematological malignancies. However, in these cases, the specific mechanism by which allo-HSCT leads to the eradication of HIV remains unclear, so it is necessary to conduct an in-depth analysis. Due to the difficulty in obtaining donors and the risks associated with transplantation, this treatment method is not applicable to all HIV patients. There is still a need to explore new treatment strategies. In recent years, emerging therapies such as neutralizing antibody immunotherapy, chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy, gene editing, and antiviral therapies targeting the reservoir have attracted wide attention due to their ability to effectively inhibit HIV replication. This article first elaborates on the nature of the HIV reservoir, then deeply explores the treatment modalities and potential success factors of HIV cured cases, and finally discusses the current novel treatment methods, hoping to provide comprehensive and feasible strategies for achieving the cure of HIV.\n",
            "Modernization of existing methods for the delivery of mRNA is vital in advanced therapeutics. Traditionally, mRNA has faced obstacles of poor stability due to enzymatic degradation. This work examines cutting-edge formulation and emerging techniques for safer delivery of mRNA vaccines. Inspired by the success of lipid nanoparticles (LNP) in delivering mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, a variety of other formulations have been developed to deliver mRNA vaccines for diverse infections. The meritorious features of nanoparticle-based mRNA delivery strategies, including LNP, polymeric, dendrimers, polysaccharide-based, peptide-derived, carbon and metal-based, DNA nanostructures, hybrid, and extracellular vesicles, have been examined. The impact of these delivery platforms on mRNA vaccine delivery efficacy, protection from enzymatic degradation, cellular uptake, controlled release, and immunogenicity has been discussed in detail. Even with significant developments, there are certain limitations to overcome, including toxicity concerns, limited information about immune pathways, the need to maintain a cold chain, and the necessity of optimizing administration methods. Continuous innovation is essential for improving delivery systems for mRNA vaccines. Future research directions have been proposed to address the existing challenges in mRNA delivery and to expand their potential prophylactic and therapeutic application.\n",
            "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Interleukin-32 (IL-32) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine primarily produced by immune cells and involved in bacterial and viral infections. This study investigates whether plasma IL-32 is associated with sepsis severity and clinical outcomes. <b>Methods:</b> Plasma IL-32 levels were measured in 186 patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, or septic shock, as well as in 40 controls. The relationship between IL-32 levels and SARS-CoV-2 or bacterial infections, alongside underlying etiological conditions, was assessed. <b>Results:</b> Patients with liver cirrhosis exhibited elevated plasma IL-32 levels. After excluding these patients, IL-32 levels were lower in SIRS/sepsis patients compared to the controls. No significant differences in IL-32 levels were observed among SIRS, sepsis, and septic shock patients. Additionally, underlying conditions such as pancreatitis and cholangitis did not influence IL-32 levels. Patients with bloodstream bacterial infections, SARS-CoV-2 infections, or no documented infection had comparable IL-32 levels. Notably, higher IL-32 levels were associated with increased mortality. <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings suggest that a reduction in plasma IL-32 levels may be protective in SIRS/sepsis patients, as elevated levels are linked to poor survival outcomes.\n",
            "<b>Background</b>: COVID-19 has largely become an endemic disease in many regions, with sporadic outbreaks, with some areas where the disease shows a seasonal pattern like the influenza virus. The focus has shifted towards managing mild and moderate forms of disease through outpatient care, aiming to prevent healthcare system overload. Consequently, identifying markers that could be used in stratifying the risk and the prognostic assessment has become crucial. Cardiovascular implications of COVID-19 are a critical area of research due to their significant impact on disease severity, mortality, and morbidity. <b>Methods</b>: We conducted a retrospective, observational study and included 472 patients, diagnosed with COVID-19, all of whom were admitted to Prof. Dr. Matei Bals National Institute of Infectious Disease, Bucharest, Romania. Levels of cardiac biomarkers like creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-myocardial band (CKMB), myoglobin, troponins, and NT-pro-BNP were measured and analyzed in relation to clinical presentation and outcomes. <b>Results</b>: We combined CKMB, myoglobin, and troponin I to predict hospital length of stay (LOS). Our model significantly predicted LOS (F = 12.537, <i>p</i> = 0.0001), with higher levels associated with prolonged stays (&#x3b2; = 0.166, <i>p</i> = 0.000). Logistic regression demonstrated that the combination of elevated CKMB and myoglobin levels significantly increased the odds of a longer LOS (OR = 1.679, <i>p</i> = 0.000). Furthermore, we found significant correlations with acute respiratory failure (<i>p</i> = 0.001), severe forms of disease (<i>p</i> = 0.000), and the development of complications during hospitalization (<i>p</i> = 0.027). <b>Conclusions</b>: These findings emphasize the value of combining cardiac biomarkers to stratify risk and predict hospital outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Routine cardiac monitoring and targeted management strategies could decrease the risk of complications, reducing the LOS. Our findings highlight the potential of cardiac biomarkers as prognostic tools to stratify risk, guide clinical interventions, and improve outcomes in COVID-19 patients.\n",
            "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in 675 million cases and 6.9 million deaths by 2022. Despite substantial declines in case fatalities following widespread vaccination campaigns, the threat of future coronavirus outbreaks remains a concern. Current treatments for COVID-19 have been repurposed from existing therapies for other infectious and non-infectious diseases. Emerging evidence suggests a role for genetic factors in both susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and response to treatment. However, comprehensive studies correlating clinical outcomes with genetic variants are lacking. The main aim of our study is the identification of host genetic biomarkers that predict the clinical outcome of COVID-19 pharmacological treatments. <b>Methods</b>: In this study, we present findings from GWAS and candidate gene and pathway enrichment analyses leveraging diverse patient samples from the Spanish Coalition to Unlock Research of Host Genetics on COVID-19 (SCOURGE), representing patients treated with immunomodulators (<i>n</i> = 849), corticoids (<i>n</i> = 2202), and the combined cohort of both treatments (<i>n</i> = 2487) who developed different outcomes. We assessed various phenotypes as indicators of treatment response, including survival at 90 days, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), radiological affectation, and type of ventilation. <b>Results</b>: We identified significant polymorphisms in 16 genes from the GWAS and candidate gene studies (TLR1, TLR6, TLR10, CYP2C19, ACE2, UGT1A1, IL-1&#x3b1;, ZMAT3, TLR4, MIR924HG, IFNG-AS1, ABCG1, RBFOX1, ABCB11, TLR5, and ANK3) that may modulate the response to corticoid and immunomodulator therapies in COVID-19 patients. Enrichment analyses revealed overrepresentation of genes involved in the innate immune system, drug ADME, viral infection, and the programmed cell death pathways associated with the response phenotypes. <b>Conclusions</b>: Our study provides an initial framework for understanding the genetic determinants of treatment response in COVID-19 patients, offering insights that could inform precision medicine approaches for future epidemics.\n",
            "This paper presents a conceptual model for understanding cross-border precarity during the COVID-19 pandemic. It examines how public health emergencies exacerbate the challenges faced by expatriates and their families in cross-border contexts. The case study illustrates the complex nature of precarity, emphasising how its various forms like systemic, institutional, economic, health, social, and psychological are interacted and intensified during the pandemic, leading to lasting instability for expatriates that extends beyond borders and impacts their families. Findings indicate that restrictive immigration policies, delayed repatriation efforts, and inadequate support mechanisms exacerbated expatriates' hardships, which in turn amplified the economic and psychological strains faced by dependents in Kerala. This paper argues for integrating expatriate needs into the International Health Regulations (IHR) for managing public health emergencies, including comprehensive guidelines for repatriation and expatriate-inclusive country capacity assessments. This model serves as a tool to inform policymakers, social work practitioners, and public health professionals in designing interventions and policies that address the unique and intersecting forms of precarity in times of crisis, ultimately contributing to a more inclusive, transnational approach to public health resilience.\n",
            "Monitoring the effectiveness of antiretroviral treatment by measuring viral load is a strong recommendation from the WHO following the intensification of this therapy, which, if well managed, improves patients' quality of life. In children, treatment options are limited and virological non-suppression is high. Virological suppression among children living with HIV who were followed at care facilities during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is poorly documented in countries with intermediate resources, such as Benin. Methods A longitudinal study was carried out from November 20, 2020, among children under 15 years of age who had been receiving ART for at least six months in five healthcare facilities. TCD4 lymphocytes (LTCD4) count was performed using the CyFlow counter II (from Partec laboratories). Viral load was performed using the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay (Abbott Molecular, Inc.). The linear range of 40-10.000.000 copies/ml and a detection limit of 40 copies/ml were defined by the manufacturers. Virological success was assessed as a suppressed viral load (VL&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;3log<sub>10</sub>). For children whose VL<sub>1</sub>&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;3log<sub>10</sub>, WHO 2016 recommendations were applied and therapeutic education sessions were offered for 3 months, after which VL<sub>2</sub> was measured. Children whose (VL<sub>1</sub> and VL<sub>2</sub>)&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;3log<sub>10</sub> were considered not suppressed. Results The mean age of 305 children enrolled was 110 (SD 41.25) months, with a predominance of girls at 52.8% (161/305). The median LTCD4 at study starting was 814 [IQR 544-1118] cells/&#xb5;l. Overall, 73.11% (223/305) of children achieved virological success at the first viral load measurement, compared to 79.63% (219/275) at the second (03 months after the first). Between the two measurements, 9.83% (30/305) of children did not keep their medical appointments due to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic restrictions. Also, 20.73% (17/82) of non-suppressed children at VL<sub>1</sub> went undetectable. Among the 17.1% (47/275) of unsuppressed children, 10.64% (5/47) were on integrase strand transfer inhibitors as DTG (Dolutegravir). Conclusion This study, conducted in children on ART during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, highlighted a high rate of retention in care and viral suppression. However, there are challenges in achieving the UNAIDS third 95 to ensure sustainable viral suppression in children.\n",
            "Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus subtype H5N1 has never been detected in New Zealand. The potential impact of this virus on New Zealand's wild birds would be catastrophic. To expand our knowledge of avian influenza viruses across New Zealand, we sampled wild aquatic birds from New Zealand, its outer islands and its subantarctic territories. Metatranscriptomic analysis of 700 individuals spanning 33 species revealed no detection of H5N1 during the annual 2023-2024 migration. A single detection of H1N9 in red knots (Calidris canutus) was noted. This study provides a baseline for expanding avian influenza virus monitoring in New Zealand.\n"

              "\"Based on the provided text, here are the answers to potential questions:\\n\\n**Regarding COVID-19 patients:**  A study of 36 COVID-19 patients found that ICU admission, pre-existing heart disease, level of physical activity, years of smoking, and days of hospitalization were all significantly related to their physical performance as measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB).  22.22% of the patients experienced frailty.  The study also found no association between ICU stay, age, or sex with SPPB results.\\n\\n**Regarding Primary Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy (PHO):** A case study describes a 24-year-old male with PHO, diagnosed through clinical, radiological, and laboratory findings.  The patient presented with skin folds on the face and forehead, joint swelling, and calf pain.\\n\\n**Regarding Thyrotropin Receptor (TSHR):**  A study found that the TSHR gene was expressed in the blood of 30% of patients with Graves' disease.\\n\\n**Regarding n-butyl methacrylate (n-BMA):** A review of studies on n-BMA concluded that there is no convincing evidence of its carcinogenicity, contradicting previous assessments.\\n\\n**Regarding Intestinal Stoma:** A study of 114 individuals with new intestinal stomas found that 43% experienced leakage and 85% had peristomal skin complications (PSCs) within the first year post-surgery.  Leakage and PSCs were associated with lower mental well-being and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).\\n\\n**Regarding Extramammary Paget Disease:** A report details a minimally invasive surgical approach (transurethral resection and oral mucosal grafting) for treating urethral extramammary Paget disease in four women, resulting in favorable oncological and functional outcomes.\""

            "Zinc finger protein 687 (ZNF687), a transcription factor implicated in osteoblast/osteoclast differentiation and linked to Paget's disease of bone, has unclear mechanisms in bone metabolism. Epigenetic disruptions can affect bone cell activity and contribute to bone-related diseases. This work aimed to elucidate the regulatory role of epigenetics in modulating <i>Zfp687</i> expression throughout osteoblast differentiation and bone growth/aging in mice. Differentiation of the mouse-derived osteoblast precursor cell line (MC3T3-E1) showed increased expression of osteogenic markers and decreased <i>Zfp687</i> expression. In the hindlimb bones of C57BL/6J mice, the expression of most bone-forming genes decreased from youth to adulthood, while <i>Zfp687</i> and <i>Runx2</i> expression was maintained, being only significantly reduced in old mice in comparison to young mice. Bisulfite sequencing revealed hypomethylation of the <i>Zfp687</i> promoter during MC3T3-E1 differentiation and bone growth/aging. Bioinformatics predicted miR-142a-3p, miR-122b-5p, and miR-124-3p binding sites in <i>Zfp687</i> 3'UTR, and RT-qPCR analysis showed higher expression of these miRNAs in mature osteoblasts. Transfection of a miR-142-3p mimic reduced luciferase activity in the wildtype <i>Zfp687</i> 3'UTR but not the mutant 3'UTR and downregulated the <i>Zfp687</i> gene and protein levels. In conclusion, miR-142a-3p directly targets the <i>Zfp687</i> 3'UTR, promoting its downregulation during osteoblastogenesis. Furthermore, DNA methylation does not appear to regulate <i>Zfp687</i> during osteoblast differentiation or bone development in mice.\n",

            "The ability to simultaneously modulate a set of genes for lineage-specific development has made miRNA an ideal master regulator for organogenesis. However, most miRNA deletions do not exhibit obvious phenotypic defects possibly due to functional redundancy. miRNAs are known to regulate skeletal lineages as the loss of their maturation enzyme Dicer impairs bone remodeling processes. Therefore, it is important to identify specific miRNA essential for bone homeostasis. We report the loss of MIR27a causing severe osteoporosis in mice. MIR27a affects osteoclast-mediated bone resorption but not osteoblast-mediated bone formation during skeletal remodeling. Gene profiling and bioinformatics further identify the specific targets of MIR27a in osteoclast cells. MIR27a exerts its effects on osteoclast differentiation through modulation of Squstm1/p62 whose mutations have been linked to Paget's disease of bone. Our findings reveal a new MIR27a-p62 axis necessary and sufficient to mediate osteoclast differentiation and highlight a therapeutic implication for osteoporosis.\n",

            "Paget's disease of bone (PDB) is characterized by excessive and disorganized bone remodeling, in which bone-resorbing osteoclasts play a key role. We investigated microRNA (miR) expression in osteoclasts derived from the blood of 40 PDB patients and 30 healthy controls. By deep sequencing, a preliminary analysis identified differentially expressed miRs in a discovery cohort of 9 PDB patients and 9 age and sex-matched healthy controls. Six mature miRs, miR-29b1-3p, miR-15b-5p, miR-181a-5p, let-7i-3p, miR-500b-5p, and miR-1246, were found to be significantly decreased in pagetic overactive osteoclasts. The differential expression of the miRs was confirmed by the analysis of a larger independent cohort using qPCR. In an integrative network biology analysis of the miR candidates, we identified strong validated interactions between the miRs and some pathways, primarily apoptosis, and major osteoclast signaling pathways including PI3K/Akt, IFN&#x3b3;, or TGF&#x3b2;, as well as c-Fos, a transcription factor, and MMP-9, a metalloprotease. In addition, other genes like CCND2, CCND1, WEE1, SAMHD1, and AXIN2 were revealed in this network of interactions. Our results enhance the understanding of osteoclast biology in PDB; our work may also provide fresh perspectives on the research or therapeutic development of other bone diseases. KEY MESSAGES: miR profile in overactive osteoclasts from patients with Paget's disease of bone. Six mature miRs were significantly decreased in pagetic osteoclasts vs controls. miRs of interest: let7i-3p, miR-15b-5p, -29b1-3p, -181a-5p, -500b-5p, and -1246. Target genes and enriched pathways highlight the importance of apoptotic pathways.\n",

            "MicroRNA (miRs) are small, non-coding RNA that post-transcriptionally regulate DNA expression. We hypothesized that specific miR profiles may be a feature of overactive osteoclasts in Paget's disease of bone (PDB), a disorder characterized by an increased and disorganized bone remodeling that typically begins with excessive bone resorption. We compared the expression profile of 13 miRs in human osteoclasts differentiated in vitro from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with PDB (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;10) or age- and sex- matched healthy subjects (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;10). We selected 13 miRs for testing, on the basis of their previously reported roles either in human osteoclast differentiation, in bone diseases, or in osteoclast important signaling pathways. From those expression results, 3 miRNAs were further selected for in-vitro studies aiming at modulating miR expression in human cord blood monocyte derived osteoclasts: 2 miRs (miR-146a-3p and miR-155-5p) whose expression was significantly reduced in pagetic osteoclasts, as well as miRNA-133a-3p, stable in PDB relative to controls, but with known regulatory importance within osteoclasts. We demonstrated a positive (miR-133a-3p) or negative (miR-155-5p, miR-146a-3p) impact of those miRs on the formation of osteoclasts and/or their bone resorption capacity in this human model. Signaling pathways were significantly affected, including p38 MAP-kinase (miR-133a-3p), RANKL-induced TRAF6/NF&#x3ba;B signaling (miR-146a-3p), and MITF expression (miR-155-5p). Osteoclast miRNA profiles might have an important value to yield significant new insights into the osteoclast phenotype in PDB and in other bone diseases with hyperactive osteoclasts.\n",

            "Paget's disease of bone (PDB) is a chronic skeletal disorder that can affect one or several bones in individuals older than 55 y of age. PDB-like changes have been reported in archaeological remains as old as Roman, although accurate diagnosis and natural history of the disease is lacking. Six skeletons from a collection of 130 excavated at Norton Priory in the North West of England, which dates to medieval times, show atypical and extensive pathological changes resembling contemporary PDB affecting as many as 75% of individual skeletons. Disease prevalence in the remaining collection is high, at least 16% of adults, with age at death estimations as low as 35 y. Despite these atypical features, paleoproteomic analysis identified sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) or p62, a protein central to the pathological milieu of PDB, as one of the few noncollagenous human sequences preserved in skeletal samples. Targeted proteomic analysis detected &gt;60% of the ancient p62 primary sequence, with Western blotting indicating p62 abnormalities, including in dentition. Direct sequencing of ancient DNA excluded contemporary PDB-associated <i>SQSTM1</i> mutations. Our observations indicate that the ancient p62 protein is likely modified within its C-terminal ubiquitin-associated domain. Ancient miRNAs were remarkably preserved in an osteosarcoma from a skeleton with extensive disease, with miR-16 expression consistent with that reported in contemporary PDB-associated bone tumors. Our work displays the use of proteomics to inform diagnosis of ancient diseases such as atypical PDB, which has unusual features presumably potentiated by yet-unidentified environmental or genetic factors.\n",

            "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic symmetrical autoimmune disease of unknown etiology that affects primarily the diarthrodial joints. Characteristic features of RA pathogenesis are synovial inflammation and proliferation accompanied by cartilage erosion and bone loss. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) display an important role in the pathogenesis of RA. Several lines of evidence show that the Wnt signaling pathway significantly participates in the RA pathogenesis. The Wnt proteins are glycoproteins that bind to the Fz receptors on the cell surface, which leads to several important biological functions, such as cell differentiation, embryonic development, limb development and joint formation. Accumulated evidence has suggested that this signaling pathway plays a key role in the FLS activation, bone resorption and joint destruction during RA development. Greater knowledge of the role of the Wnt signaling pathway in RA could improve understanding of the RA pathogenesis and the differences in RA clinical presentation and prognosis. In this review, new advances of the Wnt signaling pathway in RA pathogenesis are discussed, with special emphasis on its different roles in synovial inflammation and bone remodeling. Further studies are needed to reveal the important role of the members of the Wnt signaling pathway in the RA pathogenesis and treatment.\n",
